PURPOSE

     getzval looks up brightness values in an image at a set 
     of  points  specified in an IBIS interface  file.   The 
     brightness   average   of  a  surrounding   <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>   is 
     calculated  for each point and placed back in the  IBIS 
     interface   file.    Interpolation  is  performed   for 
     fractional  point  locations.   The  new  algorithm for 
     interpolation  causes  the  pixels  at  the edge of the 
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> to be "feathered" at less than full weight.  The
     user can choose full uniform weighting on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> or
     several circular spot algorithms.
     
     standard deviation can also be  requested.  It is calc-
     ulated as the  square  root of the weighted mean of the
     squared deviations.
     
     The keyword '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#igzero">IGZERO</A> causes zero  values to be  ignored.
     The remaining  non-zero values are  used  to  calculate
     the mean and sigma.  If there  are no non-zero  values,
     a mean of 0.0 and a sigma of 0.0 are returned.
     
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     getzval <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=(PIC,INT) SIZE PARAMS

     where

     PIC                 is an image.
     INT                 is    an   IBIS   interface    file 
                         containing columns which give point 
                         locations in the image PIC.
                         No  output  file is  used  but  the 
                         second input file is modified.
     SIZE                is the standard VICAR size field.
     PARAMS              is  the  standard  VICAR  parameter 
                         field.
OPERATION
     The  point  locations in the IBIS file are in  floating 
     point, hence they may be fractional.  The grey value is 
     calculated for a WxW interpolated grid about the  point 
     location.  Bilinear interpolation is used.  The average 
     grey  value  is  stored in the selected column  of  the 
     interface file.   In two cases,  the flag -999.0  is 
     stored:   first,  if the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> touches the boundary of 
     the  image,  or  second,  if the  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A>  threshold  is 
     achieved in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>. 
     
     The 2 x 2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> is the usual bilinear interpolation.  
     If a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> larger than 2 x 2 is used, the same bilinear
     formula is applied to the edges and corners of the 
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> area, but the interior points are added "times one".
     This means that in all cases, moving the point a fraction
     of a pixel will cause the z-value to change as the edges
     of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> move the same fraction of a pixel.
     
     THE DEFAULT BILINEAR ALGORITHM IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALMOST
     ALL CASES SINCE IT GIVES A GOOD RESULT FOR FRACTIONAL 
     PIXEL LOCATIONS AND THE RESULT FOR A LOCATION NEAR A
     PIXEL CENTER IS CLOSE TO THE RESULT FOR THE PIXEL CENTER.
     THE INTERPOLATION AT THE EDGE PIXELS IS EQUIVALENT TO
     A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF CENTER WEIGHTING, WHICH IS USUALLY
     A GOOD THING.
     
     THE INTEGRAL ALGORITHM IS NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS THE 
     (X,Y) LOCATIONS ARE INTEGRAL.  THIS ALGORITHM ALSO
     REQUIRES AN ODD <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">WINDOW</A> SIZE SO THE WINDOW CAN BE
     CENTERED ON THE (X,Y).
     
     THE SPOT ALGORITHMS ARE RECOMMENDED WHERE A CIRCULAR
     PATTERN IS DESIRED OR (IN THE CASE OF SPOT_R AND SPOT_R2)
     WHERE CENTER WEIGHTING IS DESIRED.  THESE REQUIRE AN
     ODD <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">WINDOW</A> SIZE.  THESE WOULD ALSO BE SUPERIOR FOR 
     COMPARING TWO IMAGES AT 45 DEGREE ROTATION TO EACH
     OTHER.
     
     All standard deviations are calculated as a weighted
     mean using the weight of a point in the calculation of 
     the mean.
