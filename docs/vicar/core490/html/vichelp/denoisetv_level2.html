A single 1-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">band</A> grayscale output image.

By default, the output will have the same number of bands as the 
input, and all bands will be processed. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">BAND</A> is specified, 
the output will have a single <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">band</A>.

The input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">band</A> number to use.  By default, the output will 
have the same number of bands as the input, and all bands will 
be processed. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">BAND</A> is specified, the output will have a single 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">band</A>. If a non-existent band (e.g. 4th band for a 3-band image) 
is specified, the first <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#band">band</A> is processed.

<A NAME="mu"><H3>MU</H3></A><pre>
Parameter controlling regularization.  Smaller value would apply more 
regularization, removing larger noise structures, while running the risk 
of removing features.  Larger <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#mu">MU</A> would apply less regularization, 
leaving larger noise structures in the image.

<hr>
<A NAME="lambda"><H3>LAMBDA</H3></A><pre>
Optimization parameter, which usually should be left as default.
This is the weight on the gradient term in the Split Bregman minimization.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#gamma">GAMMA</A> should be twice as large as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="gamma"><H3>GAMMA</H3></A><pre>
Optimization parameter, which usually should be left as default.
This is the weight on the fidelity term in the Split Bregman minimization.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#gamma">GAMMA</A> should be twice as large as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="iter"><H3>ITER</H3></A><pre>
Number of iterations for the algorithm to run. This number may need to
be adjusted so that the algorithm runs until convergence. The energy value 
in the output "E = xxx" could be monitored to determine whether the algorithm 
converged (i.e. whether the energy value stopped decreasing significantly).  
Experiments showed that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#iter">ITER</A> = 100 is sufficient for convergence.  In general, 
if computational time is an issue, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/denoisetv_level2.html#iter">ITER</A> could be decreased from 100.
