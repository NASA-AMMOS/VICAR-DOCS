<pre>
Single-scattering albedo of the soil particles. It characterizes the efficiency of an average particle to scatter and absorb light. 
One of the classical Hapke parameter.

This parameter gives the absolut lower limit of the single-scattering albedo of the soil particles. It characterizes the efficiency 
of an average particle to scatter and absorb light. 
If a sulution guess falls out-of-bonds then the attemp will be aborted and 
a new guess attempted.

This parameter gives the absolut upper limit of the single-scattering albedo of the soil particles. It characterizes the efficiency 
of an average particle to scatter and absorb light.

<A NAME="t_w_soil"><H3>T_W_SOIL</H3></A><pre>
This parameter gives temperatur for the single-scattering albedo of the soil 
particles. It characterizes the efficiency of an average particle to scatter 
and absorb light. 
This parameter gives the range over which random guesses can be expected to 
vary at first:
    W_SOIL_NEW = T_W_SOIL * tan( PI * ran_num + PI/2 ).
As the system cools the range will constrict gradually :
	T_W_SOIL_NEW_* = T_W_SOIL_OLD_* * scale, 
scale depends of NUMTEN.

This parameter gives temperatur for the parameter which characterizes the soil 
structure (angular width of the opposition surge due to shadowing).

<hr>
<A NAME="b_shoe"><H3>B_SHOE</H3></A><pre>
One of the classical Hapke parameter. 
Opposition magnitude coefficient. The total amplitude of the opposition surge due to shadowing. It is the ratio of the light scattered from near the illuminated surface of the particle to the total amount of light scattered at zero phase : 
B_SHOE=S(0)/(W_SOIL*p(0))
with p(0) - soil phase function
S(0) - opposition surge amplitude term which characterizes the contribution of 
light scattered from near the front surface of individual particles at zero 
phase.
For a true, shadow-hiding opposition effect, 0&lt=B_SHOE<=1.
However, there are several other phenomena that may also cause a surge in brightness at small phase angles. These including the following:
1) The coherent backscatter or weak photon localisation due to multiply 
   scattered light.
2) An single-particle opposition effect caused by complex porous agglomerates 
   ( soil phase function )
3) Glory caused by sperical particles ( soil phase function )
4) Internal reflections of transparent particles ( soil phase function )
   These various phenomena may be large enough to increase the opposition surge 
   by more than a factor of 2. This possibility may be taken into account by 
   allowing B_SHOE to be greater than 1.
