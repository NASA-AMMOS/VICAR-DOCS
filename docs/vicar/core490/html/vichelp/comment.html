PURPOSE
The COMMENT program is used to have a PDF file display a comment as it
executes. For example, to record the actions of a test file, you might
execute the following commands:
    VICAR&gtenable-log
    VICAR&gtcomment "Execution of COLOR test file before modification     VICAR>+to remove call to LABELC"
    VICAR&gttstcolor
    VICAR&gtdisable-log

These commands would produce the following session file:
    comment "Execution of COLOR test file before modification      to remove call to LABELC"
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:04:16
    Execution of COLOR test file before modification to remove call to LABELC
 
    --------------------
    tstcolor
    GEN COLORA NL=3 NS=10 IVAL=0 LINC=128 SINC=128
    Beginning VICAR task GEN                 
    GEN VERSION 5
    GEN TASK COMPLETED
    LIST COLORA
	:    :    :
    disable-log

COMMENT can also be used to simply date a session. If you enter
    VICAR&gtenable-log
    VICAR&gtcomment ""
    VICAR&gtdisable-log

the session file will contain
    comment ""
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:20
 
    --------------------
    disable-log


If no argument is supplied to COMMENT, you are interactively requested
for a comment. For example, if you place a call to COMMENT in a PDF file,
then every time the PDF file is executed, you are requested to enter a
comment; this comment can then be related to the particular session. For
example, the command sequence
    VICAR&gtenable-log
    VICAR&gtcomment

will yield the following display and prompt:
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:45
    Comment:

If you answered by typing
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

the display would show
    Comment: A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

    --------------------

The session file would contain:
    comment
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:45
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

    --------------------

If you answered by simply entering the RETURN key, then the session file
would appear the same as if you had specified the command
    comment ""


RESTRICTIONS
The comment text is limited to 79 characters.
