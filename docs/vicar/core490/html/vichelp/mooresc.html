PURPOSE
     this program operates on a single input with pixel numbers that are
     grown (separately for each number) with the Moore algorithm (see below).

     If a second ouput is given, it will contain a bitmap of the classes in
     a cluster.  The bitmap has the 1 bit wherever class 1 (given by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#pixval">PIXVAL</A> 
     parameter) participates in a cluster.  Bit 2 for class 2, bit 3 (equals
     the number 4 for class 3, etc.  The output will be byte for up to 8
     for parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#numpix">NUMPIX</A>, halfword for up to 16 and fullword for up to 32.

     mooresc grows the non-zero numbers in the input image in all
     directions an amount set by the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#dmax">dmax</A>.  Then for each
     pixel of the output image, the count of number blobs that touch
     that pixel is written to the output pixel.  NOTE THAT EACH
     INPUT NUMBER IS GROWN SEPARATELY IN ITS OWN BUFFER SPACE.
     
     The basic case grows an area of non-zero pixels by layering
     on 1 pixels, then 2 pixels, etc, for example:
     
                999999
                999
                99999
                9
                
     becomes 
                111111 
               19999991
               1999111 
               1999991
               191111 
                1 
     becomes 
                222222  
               21111112 
              2199999912
              219991112 
              219999912 
              21911112 
               212222  
                2                etc.
     
     The initial values of 9 can be any value greater than 0.
     
     The process stops when the value in the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A> is
     reached.  The term "distance" treats diagonal distance as the
     sum of horizontal and vertical distance.  Mathematically,
     this is the L1 norm or "staircase" distance, which is a distance
     function (satisfies the triangle inequality).
     
     The normal case grows equally at all edges, considering all
     non-zero values to be like the 9's in the above diagram.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     mooresc <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=(PIC1,PIC2,PIC3) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=OUTPIC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A>=n

     where

     PIC                 is an image.
     OUTPIC              is  a count of inputs with non-zero areas
                         grown by a distance of n
     n                   is a distance in pixels


OPERATION
The program reads <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A> lines of the inputs, applying the Moore
algorithm as lines are read.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core490/html/vichelp/mooresc_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A> lines are on rolling
barrel buffers, so that when the next line is read, the oldest
line is written to output, then dropped.  There is a separate 
rolling barrel for each input number.  Only one output line is
written and that is the count of non-zeros in the last line of
the rolling barrels.

TIMING

This program is WAY, WAY FASTER than using a convolution filter
(such as VICAR BOXFLT) followed by F2.
