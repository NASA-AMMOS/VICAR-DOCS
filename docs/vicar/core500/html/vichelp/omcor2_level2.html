<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2.html">OMCOR2</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
First input= SEDR.INT produced by program "ibisnav"
On output columns 21-23 are recomputed to reflect the updated 
OM matrix angles. Columns 21-23 will NOT be changed for
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control frames.
NOTE: Place those frames which will become <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control frames
at the END of the SEDR.INT file. See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter.
There can be up to 100 sedr file entries (frames).
Note: The scet columns 32-37 must be filled for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zonal">zonal</A> correction.
This can be assured by using a FILENAME file in "ibisnav".


Second input= TIEPOINTS.INT produced by program "manmatch".
This has 9 columns.
There can be up to 768 tiepoints.

A geom correction file can be entered as the third input
if the images are in image space (un geometrically corrected).
If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#project">project</A> is not GLL and no geom file is present then
nominals will be generated using the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#project">PROJECT</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#camera">CAMERA</A>
parameters.
Not necessary if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#project">project</A> is GLL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="project"><H3>PROJECT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#project">project</A> . 
Valid values are: VGR-1 VGR-2 GLL MAR-9 MAR10 VIKOR
Required.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="object"><H3>OBJECT</H3></A><pre>
Causes images to be considered geometrically corrected.
The geoma file will be ignored if present.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fit2"><H3>FIT2</H3></A><pre>
Fits two of the three angles, keeping kappa (north angle)
fixed at the input value.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="camera"><H3>CAMERA</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#camera">camera</A> serial number. Only used in 'IMAGE mode.
Defaults to the entry in the 4th ibis column of the sedr ibis file.
Only one <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#camera">camera</A> is permitted per execution of omcor2.

Voyager:
Used to assist in reading the GEOM parameters for geometric correction.

Galileo:
Used to determine the correct image space correction 
depending upon if an image is summation mode or not.
Normal images must have <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#camera">CAMERA</A>=1.
Summation mode images must have <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#camera">CAMERA</A>=2.

<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">Ground</A> control frames. The number given defines those
images in the SEDR input file which are defined
as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control frames. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> specifies the first ground control frame.
All frames after <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> will ALSO be considered to be
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control frames.
It is assumed that the
navigation contained in the first input ibis file is
rigorously correct for these frames and will not be altered.
Numbering begins at 1 for the first input, 2 for the
second input and so on. 
If you default <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> the last frame (last SEDR record) will
become the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control.
Note: If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zonal">ZONAL</A> is specified then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> is ignored and defaults to
      the last frame.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="toleranc"><H3>TOLERANC</H3></A><pre>
fractional convergence tolerance.
Controls the precision and iteration length of the function
minimization scheme. Is defined as the ratio:
2*(max_error - min_error)/(max_error + min_error)
Cannot be less than the machine real*8 precision.
Defaults to 1.0e-6

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="old"><H3>OLD</H3></A><pre>
Source of Euler angles in input SEDR.INT file.
If you specify '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#old">OLD</A> then the euler angles will come from 
columns 8,9,10. The default is they come from columns 21,22,23.
Columns 21,22,23 are initially copies of columns 8,9,10 but are updated
in-place with the program solutions.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zonal"><H3>ZONAL</H3></A><pre>
Use the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zonal">zonal</A> flow profile to shift each tiepoint by the amount of
differential rotation suffered over the interval between when that
image was obtained and when the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> control frame was obtained.
Only use for non solid planets like Jupiter. The images must be
obtained over a small time difference ( minutes not hours ) or else
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zonal">zonal</A> drift will introduce large errors.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zvp"><H3>ZVP</H3></A><pre>
Name of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zonal">zonal</A> flow file.
Defaults to jupiter.<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/omcor2_level2.html#zvp">zvp</A>
