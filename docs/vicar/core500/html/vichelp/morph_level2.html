<pre>
There are three input files.
File#1: This is the left or first input image given to
        program TRACKER or TRACKER2. 
File#2: This is the right or second input image given to
        program TRACKER. 
File#3: This is the MARK file written by program TRACKER.
        It is 'REAL' format with 512 byte records containing
        pairs of tiepoints in the order:
        left_line,left_samp,right_line,right_samp.

<A NAME="frames"><H3>FRAMES</H3></A><pre>
The number of output images produced. Outputs are the same size
as inputs. output morphs are spaced equally between the two input
images. Thus if there were 3 output images then they would be spaced
at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the way between the two input images.
The format of the output is the same as the input.

<hr>
<A NAME="start"><H3>START</H3></A><pre>
The starting number of the first output frame. Normally you would
not specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#start">START</A> and it would default to 1.  In the event that the
program were aborted in mid run you could restart it where you left off
by setting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#start">START</A>=n where n was the output frame number which was the
first missing output frame (missing because the job was cancelled).
Thus if 5 outputs were desired and only two were created then you
could restart the job USING IDENTICAL PARAMETERS AS BEFORE but
adding <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#start">START</A>=3.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="name"><H3>NAME</H3></A><pre>
The prefix for the output file names.
If you specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#name">name</A>=abc and if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#frames">frames</A>=3 for example then the three
output files will be called (in order left to right):
abc1.img abc2.img and abc3.img  .

<hr>
<A NAME="inc"><H3>INC</H3></A><pre>
The grid interval in pixels in the output image. At each grid intersection
a polynomial is fit to the nearest 4 tiepoints to perform a geom mapping
from the morph to the first and second input images. 
One tiepoint is selected from each of the 4 quadrants. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#inc">INC</A> should be
less than the tiepoint grid spacing but not much less than half of it
for efficiency .

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="npts"><H3>NPTS</H3></A><pre>
Number of  points used at each grid intersection to fit a surface
linking the morph to the left and right images geometrically.
The range is 4 to 20.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/morph_level2.html#npts">npts</A>=4 then an exact fit is made and no
extrapolation beyond the point array is permitted. Lerger values
permit a least squares fit with inverse distance weighting and
supports extrapolation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="leftonly"><H3>LEFTONLY</H3></A><pre>
Only use left image to compute the output images. This converts the program 
into a geom operation in which the left image is moved towards the right image.
The right input image is ignored.
