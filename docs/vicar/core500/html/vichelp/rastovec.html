PURPOSE:

RASTOVEC takes an image composed of regions (polygons) and produces
a vector representation of the region (polygon) boundaries.  In the input
image, each region is a connected set of pixels all having the same DN.  
The input to RASTOVEC is typically a classification map such as map produced
by VICAR program FASTCLAS.  The output of RASTOVEC consists of several files.
One output file contains a list of coordinates of polygon vertices for each
polygon (region) in the image.  Another output file, the georeference image,
is the equivalent of an IBIS PAINT image with a corresponding IBIS entry file.
Other output files contain centroid, area, and other information about the
polygons or the polygon boundaries.

PROGRAM EXECUTION:

  RASTOVEC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=(LABELEDF,POLYDESF,SERLFILE,VERTICES,POLYINFO) ....
where
  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> is the input image (byte, half, or full).
  LABELEDF is the georeferenced (or labeled) image file.
  POLYDESF is the polygon description IBIS interface file.
  SERLFILE is an intermediate file containing data for each polygon line segment.
  VERTICES is the polygon vertices IBIS graphics file.
  POLYINFO is the polygon information IBIS interface file.

The input image is, by nature, a raster representation of the polygon regions.

There are normally five output files, though some of these may be considered as
intermediate files.  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">FIRST</A> parameter is specified, only the first step
of the program is performed and only the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> two output files are produced:

	RASTOVEC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> (LABELDF,POLYDESF) '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">FIRST</A>

If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">SECOND</A> parameter is specified, only the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> two steps of the program
are performed and only the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> three output files are produced:

	RASTOVEC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> (LABELDF,POLYDESF,SERLFILE) '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">SECOND</A>

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> output file is the georeference (or labeled) image file.
The georeference image file is the same as the input image except that the DNs
for the polygons are reassigned so that each polygon has a unique DN.
The DNs are assigned by numbering the polygons consecutively (starting with 1)
in the order in which the program encounters them as it scans through the image
line by line.  The number assigned to each polygon
serves as an index by which polygon information is ordered in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">second</A>
(polygon description) output file, the fifth (polygon vertices) output file,
and the sixth (polygon information) output file.  The georeference image file
is stored in fullword integer format.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">second</A> output file is the polygon description IBIS interface file. For each
polygon in the georeference image, this file contains two values.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> is
the polygon (or class) DN from the input image.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">second</A> is the number of
pixels in the polygon.  These pairs of values are listed one pair per file row
in the order in which the polygons are numbered. 

The third output file is the SERL segment IBIS graphics file. The SERL file is
an intermediate file containing ten values for each line segment point of a
polygon boundary. 

The fourth output file is the polygon vertices IBIS graphics file. This file
gives the vector representation of the polygon boundaries.  For each polygon
the coordinates of the vertices are listed in sequence following the polygon
boundary clockwise starting with the upper left vertex of the polygon.  The
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> vertex of each list is also repeated at the end of the list and is then
followed by the coordinates (0.0, 0.0).  For each vertex, the Y (line)
coordinate is given <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> and the X (sample) coordinate is given <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">second</A>.  (Y
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A>, then X.)  The coordinates assume an origin (0,0) in the lower left (not
upper left) corner of the image. For example, in an image ten lines by five
samples, the coordinates for the upper boundary of the whole image would be
(10.01, 0.01) (upper left), and (10.01, 5.01) (upper right).  ( 0.01 is added
to all vertex coordinates so that the lower left corner is (0.01, 0.01) instead
of (0,0).) For polygons with islands, (polygons that completely surround other
polygons), the polygon boundary contains more than one connected section.  If
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">ZINGER</A> parameter is specified, the vertices of all sections of the boundary
are listed consecutively, implying the existence of a connecting line (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">zinger</A>)
between the sections of the boundary.  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">ZINGER</A> option is not specified,
the sections of the boundary are listed separately, each ending with a (0,0)
terminator. 

The fifth output file is the polygon information IBIS interface file. For each
polygon in the georeference image, this file contains a row of ten real values.
The ten values are: 
  1     number of islands in the polygon
  2     number of vertices
  3     polygon DN (class number)
  4     minimum X coordinate in polygon
  5     maximum X coordinate in polygon
  6     minimum Y coordinate in polygon
  7     maximum Y coordinate in polygon
  8     X coordinate of 'centroid' of polygon
  9     Y coordinate of 'centroid' of polygon
 10     area (number of pixels) for the polygon

These groups of ten values are listed in the order in which the polygons are
numbered. 

Caution:  The 'centroid' coordinates are not necessarily the coordinates
of the centroid of the polygon but are the coordinates of a point in the 
polygon.

OPERATION:

     RASTOVEC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=(LABELEDF,POLYDESF,SERLFILE,VERTICES,POLYINFO)

The basic algorithm was developed by David A. Nichols (1981) and consists of
three separate tasks.

     Step 1                     Step 2            Step 3
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#inp">INP</A> -------&gt LABELEDF,POLYDESF -------> SERLFILE -------> VERTICES,POLYINFO

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> task involves identifying all raster polygons in the image.  A raster
polygon is defined as any number of horizontally or vertically contiguous pixels
having the same DN (label).  The pixels in each raster polygon are assigned a
new DN (label) which is unique to each polygon, and the image is output with
an accompanying directory (POLYDESF) for relating class DNs (labels) to the
new unique label system.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#second">second</A> task involves creating the line segments which define the polygon
boundaries.  Each line segment is encoded by recording its starting and ending
line-sample coordinates and the labels of the polygons to the right and left
of the segment (Start,End,Right,Left or SERLFILE).

The third task traverses the SERLFILE and connects appropriate adjacent
line segments.  This gives a list of polygon vertices for each polygon.  The
(x,y) graphics coordinates of each vertex is stored in the VERTICES file.

The Nichols algorithm codes polygons in a clockwise manner with islands
coded twice: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#first">first</A> in a counterclockwise manner stored at the end of the host
polygon's vertex coordinates, and then again as a regular polygon.  Lollipops
(pseudo islands connected by one vertex to the host polygon) are treated as
regular polygons.  

A simple raster polygon with parts connected to each other diagonally
(as opposed to horizontally or vertically) will be broken into two or more
polygons after vector conversion.  Diagonal connections are not supported
by the program.  

The centroid algorithm appears to reliably place centroids within polygons
although a centroid may be placed very close to the borders of an odd-shaped
polygon.  If the vector coordinates are later PAINTed (with VICAR program
PAINT using the PBORDER option) into raster format, centroids near the border
may become attached to the neighboring polygon due to the random assignment
of border pixels by the PAINT program.  

If the vector file is to be plotted, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">ZINGER</A> option should not be used as
it will maintain all polygon island connections and will result in many
criss-crossing lines (zingers).  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">ZINGER</A> option is not used, area
calculations will be wrong for polygons with islands.

If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#zinger">ZINGER</A> option is used, islands will retain their connection to the last
polygon.  For the figure below, vertex coordinates will be coded in the order:
A',...,A',B',...,B',A',D',...D',A'.

MEMORY AND DISK REQUIREMENTS:

RASTOVEC requires that large amounts of virtual memory be available.  This
implies that large amounts of scratch disk space be present.  In addition,
sufficient physical memory must be available to avoid excessive page swapping.

As a test case, the program was run on a large (3601 x 3601) and extremely
complex image (worst case scenario).  Execution time (wall clock) was 32:50
(or 1970 seconds).  The program required 200 megabytes of virtual memory

  Assuming execution time is proportional to image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/rastovec_level2.html#size">size</A>, the
program requires
152 seconds per million pixels.
