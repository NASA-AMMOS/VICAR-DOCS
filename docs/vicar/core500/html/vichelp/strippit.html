<H1>Help for STRIPPIT</H1>
<pre>
PURPOSE:
 
   STRIPPIT is a TAE process which takes an image and puts it into strips
of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#striplen">STRIPLEN</A> lines with a spacing of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#gapwidth">GAPWIDTH</A> number of samples between the
strips.  It was written to facilitate the formatting of long and skinny
flight lines for playback.
 
EXECUTION:
 
   The following is the execution statement format for STRIPPIT:
 
		STRIPPIT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#inp">INP</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#out">OUT</A> PARAMS
 
   where <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#inp">INP</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#out">OUT</A>, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their respective
parameter sections. 
OPERATION:
 
   STRIPPIT does the seemingly simple task of cutting and pasting long slender
flight line images into parallel strips in order to format the images for
playback.  It uses a slightly more complex algorithm than would seem necessary
because of the inefficiency of non-sequential I/O (especially XVREADing) which
would slow down the operation considerably.  Instead, a maximum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#size">size</A> buffer is
allocated for the output, and the reading and writing is done on a block by
block basis, one block being the maximum number of lines by the number of
strips necessary in the output.

   The two unique parameters (other than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>) are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#striplen">STRIPLEN</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#gapwidth">GAPWIDTH</A>.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#striplen">STRIPLEN</A> lets the user select the number of lines of the strips, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#gapwidth">GAPWIDTH</A>
sets the number of samples spacing between the image strips.  The defaults
are set up for standard TIMS processing.

   This program was written to facilitate the processing of TIMS data, which
has come in lengths of over 22,000 lines in a single flight line.  It can just
as well be used by anyone working with long flight lines of AIS, NS001 or other
airborne sensors, however.
 
 
RESTRICTIONS:
 
   As it is currently designed, the output can be in no wider than 10,000
pixels, and must be byte format.

   The input dataset must be repeated in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/strippit_level2.html#inp">INP</A> parameter, once for every
strip to be output. For example, an image that is divided into 3 segments must
have the input dataset listed 3 times with the IMP parameter.
