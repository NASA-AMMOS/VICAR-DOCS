<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv.html">GEOMV</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input file name.  This parameter is input as:
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=innam
where "innam" is the input file name.

The second file, if given, is an IBIS file containing a trans-
formation grid in four columns specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#cols">COLS</A> parameter.
This allows large grids, say 500 x 500 or 1000 x 1000.

The third file, if given, is a VICAR image containing a GeoTIFF
label.  In this case, the output image is assumed to have the
same coordinates as the GeoTIFF labelled image except for the
translation produced by the (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#sl">sl</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#ss">ss</A>) coordinates.  This translation
is put into the GeoTIFF coordinate information and the GeoTIFF
label is added to the output.  For an illustration of Automatic
GeoTIFF labelling, see the two PDF's included in the geomv.com
file named gtwarp.pdf and tstgtwarp.pdf.

<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output and intermediate file names. This parameter is input as:

where:
"outnam" is the output file name, and

<A NAME="size"><H3>SIZE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> field is specified with four arguments,
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>=(a,b,c,d)
where:
a is the starting line number of the output picture.
b is the starting sample of the output picture.
c is the number of lines, and
d is the number of samples
For example, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>=(1,1,40,50)
would create an output picture of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> 40 lines by 50 bytes.
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> field can be thought of as a window relative to the output
grid.  The first two values offset the window down and to the right
causing the features in the image to move up and to the left.

<A NAME="sl"><H3>SL</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#sl">SL</A> can be used to specify the starting line of the output picture.
This is actually a coordinate relative to the output grid, therefore,
it offsets the output picture by (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#sl">SL</A> - 1.)  The default for SL is 1.

<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#ss">SS</A> can be used to specify the starting sample of the output picture.
This is actually a coordinate relative to the output grid, therefore,
it offsets the output picture by (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#ss">SS</A> - 1.)  The default for SS is 1.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nl">NL</A> can be used in conjunction with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#ns">NS</A> in place of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>
parameter to specify the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of lines for output.

<hr>
<A NAME="interp"><H3>INTERP</H3></A><pre>
This parameter has four valid keyword values: NOIN, BILIN,
CUBCONV, and CUBSPLIN

NOIN means no interpolation.   The default method (used when neither
keyword is specified) for computing the
DN values of the output picture is to use a bi-linear interpolation
on the four nearest neighbors in the input picture.  With NOIN, the
value of the nearest point is simply used.
For example, say a point in the output picture was determined
to have come from point (R,P) in the input picture.  Since R and P
are real values, we must somehow calculate a DN value for that
point.  Take IR and IP as the truncated values.  We then have
          VAL1                                 VAL2
           *                                    *
         (IR,IP)                              (IR,IP+1)
                     POINT
                       *
                     (R,P)
          VAL3                                 VAL4
           *                                    *
         (IR+1,IP)                           (IR+1,IP+1)
Here, POINT is the result of a bilinear interpolation using
VAL1, VAL2, VAL3, and VAL4.
If NOIN is specified, then POINT would be VAL1, the nearest
neighbor.

CUBCONV:  (reference Goshtasby on the web)
CUBSPLIN: (reference Goshtasby on the web)

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#znoin">ZNOIN</A> specifies that an interpolation is done except
when one or more of the points used has a value equal to zero. 
In that case the nearest neighbor method is used.
This allows preparation of sharp edges (no interpolation rolloff)
for mosaicking.

<A NAME="nah"><H3>NAH</H3></A><pre>
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nah">nah</A> is number of grid cells horizontally, the number of tiepoints 
across is one larger (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nah">nah</A>+1).

<A NAME="nav"><H3>NAV</H3></A><pre>
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nav">nav</A> is number of grid cells vertically, the number of tiepoints
vertically is one larger (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nav">nav</A>+1).

<A NAME="cols"><H3>COLS</H3></A><pre>
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>=(C1,C2,C3,C4)   Columns in the IBIS tabular file that
			 contain the tiepoints.  C1 has new line,
			 C2 has new sample, C3 has old line, and
			 C4 has old sample.  This parameter is used
			 only if the IBIS file input is given.  The
			 defaults are (1,2,3,4) and they are automat-
			 ically given if a TIECONV type program is 
			 used.

<hr>
<A NAME="tiepoint"><H3>TIEPOINT</H3></A><pre>
There are four real numbers for each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">tiepoint</A> , the first two are the
line-sample coordinate in the output, the second two are the line-sample
coordinate in the input which is mapped to the point in the output.  There
must be (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nah">nah</A>+1)*(<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nav">nav</A>+1) tiepoints (quadruple)s aligned in a perfectly
horizontal and vertical grid.  THE OUTPUT GRID MUST ALSO BE UNIFORMLY
SPACED IN EACH DIRECTION.  THE SPACING VERTICALLY DOES NOT HAVE TO
EQUAL THE SPACING HORIZONTALLY THOUGH (MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN LGEOM).
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OUTPUT GRID VALUES CAN BE FRACTIONAL (LGEOM
REQUIRES WHOLE NUMBERS).  THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE EASY TO MEET IF THE
GRID IS GENERATED MATHEMATICALLY OR IF A PROGRAM SUCH AS TIECONV IS USED.

<A NAME="parms"><H3>PARMS</H3></A><pre>
A parameter data set containing the geom parameters.  This file should
have been written by a program which uses the XVP routines for writing
parameter data sets.  This is the most common means by which the parameters
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">TIEPOINT</A> are passed.

<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tmpfile"><H3>TMPFILE</H3></A><pre>
If the warp area of the input image is larger than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#vmemsize">VMEMSIZE</A>, the program
shifts into a "strip processing" mode using the filename given by parameter
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A> followed by a sequence of digits to create one file for each strip.
Then all of the strips are concatenated to give the final output.  Each piece
of each strip is designed to fit within the user provided or defaulted virtual
memory <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#size">size</A>.  Do not use a link for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A>.  Instead, you can use a path/filename
for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A>.  This is because multiple files will be created with TMPFILE as a
root.  You must delete the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A> files after the run.
