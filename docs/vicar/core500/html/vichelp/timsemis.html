PURPOSE:
     TIMSEMIS is a program to generate spectral emissivity images from
calibrated TIMS data. The input dataset should be the 6 calibrated (IRAD or
GRAD) TIMS channels. The first output will contain the 6 spectral emittance
images, while the second output will contain the temperature image.
     Three algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first method,
called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified constant
emittance value. The default sets Channel 6 to 0.95. The temperature is computed
based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference channel, then the 
other five spectral emittances are computed, using this temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the six spectral
emittances, based upon the computed temperature.
     The third method, TWOCHAN, estimates the temperature by assuming that
the emissivity is exactly equal in the two channels whose blackbody fit
emissivities are most nearly equal.  The kinetic temperature is then
computed to fit the ratio of the radiances of those two channels, then each 
of the emissivities is calculated.
