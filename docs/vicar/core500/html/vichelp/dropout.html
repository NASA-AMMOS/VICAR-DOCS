PURPOSE:
"dropout" is a VICAR program which finds and fixes pixel drop outs and
missing lines. Viking Orbiter images can have series of zero pixels
corresponding to data missing from the tape recorder. Data was
originally recorded longitudinally on the tape but was played back
latitudinally. When a data outage occurred, a regular pattern of
missing pixels resulted. Ground reconstruction of the data sometimes
lost whole lines. DROPOUT fixes both of these problems by
interpolating over the missing data.

OPERATION:
"dropout" reads each line and locates the missing lines, saving the
line numbers in a buffer. Up to 2000 lines can be saved. If the line
is not missing, the line is examined pixel by pixel to locate missing
pixels. The missing pixels are fixed by interpolation. After each
line is fixed, DROPOUT goes back to fix the missing lines. Data is
determined to be missing if the pixel values are less than or equal
to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/dropout_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> (default is THRESH=0) 

TIMING:
depends on number of missing pixels and lines but usually only a
couple of minutes. 

EXECUTION:
  "dropout" can be executed in the following manner:

  explained in their respective PARAMETER section.
