<pre>
There are up to 2 input files:
1. The image whose label and spice/sedr to list.
2. The geom correction file for the first input.
   The second file is optional. If not included,
   nominals will be generated.

<A NAME="update"><H3>UPDATE</H3></A><pre>
To <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#update">update</A> the SEDR or SPICE
Specifies whether subroutine PUTSPICE is to be called.
The default (NOUPDATE) is to NOT call PUTSPICE.
Note that the sedr/spice will be updated with the
source specified by the DESTINATION keyword .

<A NAME="target"><H3>TARGET</H3></A><pre>
Ex: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#target">TARGET</A>=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#target">TARGET</A> may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#target">target</A> names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

<A NAME="spicemode"><H3>SPICEMODE</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#spicemode">SPICEMODE</A>=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#spicemode">SPICEMODE</A>=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#spicemode">SPICEMODE</A> is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

<A NAME="ckname"><H3>CKNAME</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#ckname">CKNAME</A> is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK

Ex:  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#ckid">CKID</A>=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#ckid">CKID</A> overrides the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/spice_level2.html#ckname">CKNAME</A> parameter.
