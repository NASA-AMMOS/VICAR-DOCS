PURPOSE

   CHKSPACE returns the number of free blocks (512 bytes) available to this
user on a specific disk drive.  The amount returned is the amount left in
the user's quota if quotas are enabled, or the amount left on the disk, if  
no quotas are enabled.  If the parameter DISK is not a disk name, the
program will issue an error message and return 0 blocks.  If the parameter
DISK is not supplied, the current default disk is used. 
.IF1 UNIX
Disk quotas are not used on UNIX devices.

   Important note:  CHKSPACE does not reserve the space or in anyway 
   assure that the same amount of space will be available at any time
   in the near future.  It is an advisory only.  

EXECUTION

   CHKSPACE 
       - will return a message containing space left available on
       the current default disk.

   CHKSPACE disk 
       - will return a message containing the space available on
       the specified disk.

   CHKSPACE disk variable
       - will return a message containing the space available on
       the specified disk and will put the value in the specified
       TCL variable.  The variable must have been declared as an
       integer. (e.g. local vari int)
         
RESTRICTIONS

       None.

MESSAGES
   
    CHKSPACE: Space constrained by disk space.
       Issued when the free space available is limited only be the
       number of blocks left on the disk.

.IF VAX_VMS
    CHKSPACE: Space constrained by your disk quota.
       Issued when the free space available is limited by your 
       remaining disk quota.

    CHKSPACE: You have no disk quota on this disk.
       Issued when a disk has active quotas, but you do not have
       an authorized quota on the disk.
    
    CHKSPACE: This is the null device.
       Issued when the disk name provided is the null (infinite) device.
.IFEND

    CHKSPACE: DISK name not valid.
       Issued when the disk name provided is not a disk device.

REVISION: 1  (26-FEB-1990)
          Made portable for UNIX   Richardson(CRI) 2-JAN-95
          As per FR85841, -a option on df removed because doesn't exist on
          Andes. chkspace.ush now works in any directory, not just root. 8/95
16-Feb-2011 -lwk- renamed chkspace.ush to chkspace_scr.sh and wrapped it in a 
	separate .com file, in order to ensure that it gets created with the
	proper protections upon system build;  added "-k" to df in chkspace_scr.ush, 
	since df has changed;  changed "nawk" to "awk" because Linux doesn't know 
	nawk.
