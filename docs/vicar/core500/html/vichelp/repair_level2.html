      The program REPAIR operates in three different modes: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A> (the default),
 MV, and ALL. 
      If ALL is specified, no statistical checking is performed, and all 
 regions specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> parameters are 
 replaced by interpolating the nearest two lines.
      In the CORRelation <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, a line is considered to be a good line if the
 correlation coefficient between it and the last good line is greater than the
 threshold value specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A>. The line is also considered good if its
 correlation with the average of the last good line and the next line is above
 the threshold.
      If MV is specified, two tests are made, in addition to the correlation
 test. The difference in means must be less than the value specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">MEAN</A>,
 and the difference in variances must be less than the value specified by
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">VARIANCE</A>. If a line passes all three tests, it is considered good.

      The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> parameters are used to limit the 
 portion of the image in which lines may be replaced. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> is used to 
 identify individual lines to be checked. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A> is used to specify sets of 
 lines, in the format (SL1,NL1,SL2,NL2,...), when the general region of concern
 is known, but not the exact location. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> parameter is used to test
 and/or replace bad lines that may occur in a periodic fashion.  For example,
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A>=(4,20) could be used to test/replace every 20th line, starting with
 Line 4. Unlike the other parameters, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> acts as an additional restriction.
 If more than one of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> are specified, then a line
 is tested/replaced if it satisfies any of the parameters, but if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> and
 another parameter is specified, then the line must meet both criteria to be
 tested/replaced. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A> parameter allows the user to select a portion of 
 the lines to be examined. The values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A> must be specified in sets of 
 four, (SL1,SS1,NL1,NS1,SL2,SS2,NL2,NS2,...). 
      If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is ALL, then all pixels in the regions specified are replaced 
 by interpolation of the adjacent two lines. 
      If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A> or MV, these values describe the region from which 
 statistics are gathered. If a line is found to be  bad, the entire line is 
 replaced. 
      <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core500/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> accept up to 100 regions, and all three may
 be used in the same task. However, if two of the regions contain a common
 line, then the regions are combined (and perhaps enlarged) into the 
 rectangular region that contains both of them.
