The centroid wavelength value for each channel in micrometers. This can be 
calculated for a TIMS image using TIMSRESP (The central wavelength values are
dumped to the screen after the program runs).

TES uses an empirical calibration curve to calculate the emissivity minimum 
from the temperature independant MMD ratio. This calibration curve was derived 
by convolving ASTER library spectra to the ASTER or MASTER channels and 
plotting the MMD against the emissivity minimum. The empirical formula has the 
form:

a-b*MMD^c

where the coefficients (a, b and c) are determined for either ASTER or MASTER. 
In the caseof MASTER they are provided for the case where you have all 10 
MASTER thermal channels and also the case where you have the inner 8 MASTER 
channels. This latter case is provided since the shortest and longest 
wavelength MASTER channels are strongly influenced by the atmosphere and often 
a better result is obtained by excluding these channels from TES since they 
typically contain residual atmospheric effects which will negatively influence 
the result.

ASTER 6 band
a = 0.994
b = 0.687
c = 0.737 

MASTER 10 band
a = 1.001
b = 0.761
c = 0.812

MASTER 8 band
a = 0.990
b = 0.757
c = 0.834

where MMD is the maximum difference of the beta ratio and ^ = raise to power.
