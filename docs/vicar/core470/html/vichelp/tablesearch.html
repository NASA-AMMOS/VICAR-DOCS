<H1>Help for TABLESEARCH</H1>
<pre>
PURPOSE:
	A procedure generally used in camera calibration processing to
	search and extract records from an input file.  The input file is
	created by prf (Point Response Function) and records are extracted
	from it using either or both of two methods.  If SIZE is specified
	by the user then the sums of the columns SLBOX + CLINBOX and SSBOX  	CSINBOX must lie in the rectangle defined by SIZE.  If CL, CS, and
	RADIUS are specified by the user then the point represented by the
	fractional parts of the columns CLINBOX and CSINBOX must lie inside
	the circle defined by (x - CS)^2 + (y - CL)^2 = RADIUS^2.  If the
	circle crosses the square defined by (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,0)
	then wrap-around is taken into account.

	If either SIZE or RADIUS retain their default values then that
	method of selection is ignored.  Consequently if they both retain
	their default values then all the records in the input file are
	selected and copied to the output file.  If they are both specified
	then selected records must satisfy both conditions.

	Note: As a consequence of using program mf, tablesearch changes the
	value of WORK column 10 in the input file.  This column was set up
	to be used by tablesearch.

EXECUTION:
	tablesearch inp=input.file out=out.file size=(257,257,512,512)  		    cl=0.5 cs=0.3 radius=0.2

	The above command line uses both methods to select records from the
	input file and copy them to the output file.


METHOD:
	1) Use tablelist on input.file to list the records.
	2) Next use tablesearch to search and extract records based on
	   either or both of the two methods described above.

HISTORY:
