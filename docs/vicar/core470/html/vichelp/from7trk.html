<H1>Help for FROM7TRK</H1>
<pre>
 PURPOSE:
      The Science Digital Data Preservation Task (SDDPT) has transcribed the
data from a large number of archived 1/2 inch CCT tapes onto a set of CD-ROM's.
While the datasets transcribed from 9 track tapes are, in general, readable
by way of previously existing software, the datasets transcribed from 7 track
tapes need a reformatting step to be usable by current VICAR programs. 
FROM7TRK is a VICAR program that provides this reformatting step.
      Since 7 track tape drives were used only during the IBM era, translation
of the IBM VICAR labels (in EBCDIC) into VICAR2 (ASCII) labels was also
necessary.
 RESTRICTIONS:
      While this program attempts to handle any possible valid IBM VICAR
label, there were no available test datasets for numerous options, and a
complete list of possible valid VICAR label formats is lost to the mists
of time.  In particular, the following options have been programmed in
but not tested: non-byte data, VICAR labels longer than 360 bytes, and the
LABEL77 label format.
      If this program encounters a problem with any of these formats, please
