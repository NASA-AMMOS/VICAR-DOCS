PURPOSE
     TGMTRI accepts as input the triangles file that is output by TRIGRID, and
produces an image of those triangles.  That is, the output file is an image
dataset of the size of the rectified image. The value of each pixel (halfword)
is the number of the triangle to be used to generatate that pixel during
rectification.
     For example, assume that Line 50, Sample 30 in the output image has the 
value 200.  This means that triangle 200 is to be used to compute the input
pixel location that maps to Line 50, Sample 30.  The coefficients for this
transformation will be in Record (Line) 200 of the input file.  In the output
image from TGMTRI, the pixels with the value 200 will form a triangular
region that includes Line 50, Sample 30.
