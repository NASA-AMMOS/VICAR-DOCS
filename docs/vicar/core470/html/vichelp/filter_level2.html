<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
The first file is the input image file that is to be filtered.
The second file, if present, contains the entire window of filter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">weights</A>,
in a VICAR labelled image file.  If the second file is present, the parameters
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#nlw">NLW</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#nsw">NSW</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#symm">SYMM</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">WEIGHTS</A> are ignored, since their values are either 
supplied or implied by the contents of the secon input file.

be filtered.
<p>
<p></pre>

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
Number of lines in the area to be filtered.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>

<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nlw"><H3>NLW</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the number of lines of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">weights</A>. Must be odd.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nsw"><H3>NSW</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the number of samples in each line of the weight matrix.
Must be odd.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="symm"><H3>SYMM</H3></A><pre>
This keyword parameter indicates which portion of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">weights</A> matrix is 
given in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">WEIGHTS</A> parameter.  When only part of the weights matrix is
given, the remaining parts are generated by reflection through the center
lines.
      UL     - (the default) indicates that the upper left quadrant has
               been specified.
      UPPER  - indicates that the upper half of the matrix has been given.
      LEFT   - indicates that the left half of the matrix has been given.
      ALL    - indicates that all elements of the matrix have been given.
For compatibility, the values NONSYMME and ASYMMETR are also allowed. They
have the same meanings as UPPER and ALL, respectively.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="weights"><H3>WEIGHTS</H3></A><pre>
These are the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">weights</A> to be used in the filter.  They should be ordered from
left to right, the top to bottom.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="divide"><H3>DIVIDE</H3></A><pre>
The result of the filtering and rescaling (via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> parameters) is divided
by this value prior to the clipping to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> parameter.
Each output point O(l,s) is given by:

        O(l,s) = GAIN*(T(l,s)/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#divide">DIVIDE</A>) + OFFSET

where GAIN and OFFSET are defined by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> and T is the output of the 
convolution.  The default is that the sum of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#weights">weights</A> is used.  If this 
sum is zero, then 1.0 is used.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
This keyword specifies the application of a linear transformation to each
filtered value T(l,s):

        O(l,s) = GAIN*(T(l,s)/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#divide">DIVIDE</A>) + OFFSET

where <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A>=(OFFSET,GAIN).  Default is SCALE=(0,1).
See also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#divide">DIVIDE</A>.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnmin"><H3>DNMIN</H3></A><pre>
All pixels with DN less than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmin">DNMIN</A> upon output are set to DNMIN. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmin">DNMIN</A> is synonymous with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>(1).
The default is the least value of the data format.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnmax"><H3>DNMAX</H3></A><pre>
All pixels with DN greater than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmax">DNMAX</A> upon output are set to DNMAX. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmax">DNMAX</A> is synonymous with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>(2).
The default is the largest value of the data format.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="range"><H3>RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The pair of values (a,b) specifies the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">range</A> of DN to which the output will
be clipped.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is synonymous with (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmin">DNMIN</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#dnmax">DNMAX</A>).  If both RANGE and DNMIN or DNMAX
are specified, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> will take precedence.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="edge"><H3>EDGE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies image handling at image boundaries.  Setting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/filter_level2.html#edge">EDGE</A>=CYCLE or 'CYCLE
causes the program to treat the image as if it wrapped around at boundaries
in both directions.  'LCYCLE and 'SCYCLE cause wrap-around in the line and
sample direction only, respectively.  The default is for the program to 
reflect the image at the boundaries.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="parms"><H3>PARMS</H3></A><pre>
 set. Any combination of the allowable parameters may be given. If
 any of the parameters are given interactively, the interactive value
 takes precedence.
