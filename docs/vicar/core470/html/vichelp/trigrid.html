PURPOSE
     The program TRIGRID takes a set of tiepoints that have been acquired for
image registration and produces a list of triangular areas whose vertices are 
the input tiepoints.  Associated with each output triangle is a set of six 
coefficients.  The coefficients define the linear transformation to be used 
to geometrically rectify the pixels within that triangle.  The input tiepoint 
dataset must be in the format produced by PICREG; the output triangles dataset 
is in a format compatible with the program TGEOM1.
OPERATION
     TRIGRID first creates a set additional, synthetic tiepoints which are
spaced at regular intervals arround the edge of the raw image.  Inclusion of
these added tiepoints allows triangles to be formed which surround all pixels
in the raw image.  The synthetic tiepoints are created in the following manner:
(1) The line and sample coordinates for the tiepoints in the raw image are 
    placed along the image borders, at equal intervals.
(2) For each raw tiepoint location, the three nearest input (not synthetic)
    tiepoints are located.
(3) Those three tiepoints are used to define a linear transformation to the 
    rectified coordinate system, which is then used to compute the location
    of the tiepoint in the transformed image.
     To form triangles from these tiepoints, line segments are formed by 
joining all possible pairs of tiepoints.  The length of each segment (in the
raw coordinate system) is computed, and the segments are sorted by length.
The segments are then tested for inclusion in the set of triangle sides,
testing from short to long segments.  A segment is included if it does not
intersect (except at endpoints) another (shorter) segment that is already
included in the set.  The segment must meet this test in both the old and the
new reference systems; otherwise, the segment is discarded.  Once all segments
have been tested, the remaining segments form a grid of triangles, except in
the case listed below.
     This method for creating triangles may produce an incomplete or 
unsatisfactory set of triangles under one circumstance.  If a segment
is excluded because it crosses a shorter segment in the new reference system
but not the old, there may be a resulting area not enclosed by a triangle.
This will result in a part of the image being missed during rectification;
the output image will appear to have a tear or gore in it.  Usually, this
problem occurs only if an exterior tiepoint is involved; problems with
interior tiepoints tend to be resolved with the inclusion of subsequent 
(longer) segments.  In the extreme case, the tranformation may "flip over" 
from input to output triangle. This yields a discontinuous transformation 
across the triangle boundary, in addition to a gore. 
     Each of these conditions is noted by a warning message.  The user 
is advised to examine and perhaps edit the set of tiepoints before proceeding,
if warning messages have been issued.
     Once the set of triangles have been formed, they are sorted by output
line of the top vertex.  The vertices of each triangle are also sorted, top
to bottom.  The six transformation coefficients are then computed for the
linear transformation from old triangle to new.  That is, coefficients are
computed to solve the following two equations:

          LINE    =  c *LINE    + c *SAMPLE   + c
              in      1     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#out">out</A>    2       out   3


        SAMPLE    =  c *LINE    + c *SAMPLE   + c
              in      4     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#out">out</A>    5       out   6


The output of TRIGRID consists of a set of records (VICAR lines), one for 
each triangle produced.  Each record holds the following 12 values:

              Sample       Meaning
              ------       -------
                 1         Top vertex line number, in output image
                 2         Top vertex sample number, in output image
                 3         Middle vertex line number, in output image
                 4         Middle vertex sample number, in output image
                 5         Bottom vertex line number, in output image
                 6         Bottom vertex sample number, in output image
               7-12        The coefficients c -c , in the two equations above.
                                             1  6

RESTRICTIONS:          The maximum number of tiepoints allowed is 1000.
