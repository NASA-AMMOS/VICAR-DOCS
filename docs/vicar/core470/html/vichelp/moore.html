PURPOSE

     moore grows the non-zero areas of an image in all directions
     an amount set by the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#dmax">dmax</A>.  a special case is
     available that can grow different borders of the non-zero
     areas by different amounts (depending on the initial border
     pixel values).
     
     The basic case grows an area of non-zero pixels by layering
     on 1 pixels, then 2 pixels, etc, for example:
     
                999999
                999
                99999
                9
                
     becomes 
                111111 
               19999991
               1999111 
               1999991
               191111 
                1 
     becomes 
                222222  
               21111112 
              2199999912
              219991112 
              219999912 
              21911112 
               212222  
                2                etc.
     
     The initial values of 9 can be any value greater than 0.
     
     The process stops when the value in the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A> is
     reached.  The term "distance" treats diagonal distance as the
     sum of horizontal and vertical distance.  Mathematically,
     this is the L1 norm or "staircase" distance, which is a distance
     function (satisfies the triangle inequality).
     
     The normal case grows equally at all edges, considering all
     non-zero values to be like the 9's in the above diagram.  The
     keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#edgeval">EDGEVAL</A> causes the program to treat all non-zero values
     as an already calculated distance.  So, if one of the edge pixels
     is already a 2, then it does not grow a 1 but will start growing
     neighbors at 3.  This can be used to grow different edges at
     different distances.  Keep in mind that the minimum "growth"
     number now becomes 2.
     
     The keyword '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#outone">OUTONE</A> will output all of the non-zero input
     values as a one (but not the Moore values).
     
     The keyword '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#growone">GROWONE</A> will output all of the Moore distance
     values as a one (but not the non-zero input values).  This 
     is useful perhaps for identifying the Moore distance areas
     with a unique value (have all input pixels &gt1 and do not
     use '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#edgeval">EDGEVAL</A>).
     
     The use of '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#outone">OUTONE</A> and '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#growone">GROWONE</A> together will produce an
     image that is all 0's and 1's (a binary mask).
     
     Logically, there are eight possible cases using the three
     keywords '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#edgeval">EDGEVAL</A>, '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#outone">OUTONE</A> and '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#growone">GROWONE</A>.
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     moore <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=PIC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=OUTPIC <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/moore_level2.html#dmax">DMAX</A>=n PARMS

     where

     PIC                 is an image.
     OUTPIC              is  a copy of PIC with non-zero areas
                         grown by a distance of n
     n                   is a distance in pixels
                         'OUTONE and 'GROWONE.

OPERATION
The program reads DMAX lines of the input, applying the Moore
algorithm as lines are read.  The DMAX lines are on a rolling
barrel buffer, so that when the next line is read, the oldest
line is written to output, then dropped.

TIMING

About twice as slow as an image copy.  This program is WAY, WAY
FASTER than using a convolution filter (such as VICAR BOXFLT)
followed by F2.
