PURPOSE

     rpc2ibis reads the RPC fields of a VICAR image and places them in an
     IBIS file.  The IBIS file must be 80 columns in length.  The 80 RPC's
     are placed in one column in the A or B order (the same order as in the
     image.  The second column has the scales and offsets saved in records
     6 through 15.  Records 3 through 5 have the success, error_bias, and 
     error_rand values.  Record one has 0.0 for type A and 10 for type B.
     Record two has the "length" field from the original source file (though
     it means little in this format).

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     rpc2ibis <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/rpc2ibis_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=(A,B) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/rpc2ibis_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>=(C1,C2)
     
     where

     A	     is a VICAR image with a GeoTIFF label with RPC or a
                      standalone ascii GeoTIFF label with RPC
     B           is an IBIS file 
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/rpc2ibis_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>        are the IBIS file columns (integers) to receive the
                 coefficients of the RPC's and the scales and offsets, etc.

OPERATION
   The GeoTIFF label is accessed and the RPC's are read. They are written to an
   ibis file.
   

TIMING

     Less than a second.
     
RESTRICTIONS

   The IBIS file must have length 80, and the column must be double precision.
