PURPOSE:
gtmss combines up to 48 datasets into a single dataset with mss format.
This is equivalent to concatenating the input images in a left to right
fashion.  The program works like VICAR routine MSS if there are no
GeoTIFF labels.  If there are, the GeoTIFF labels of the inputs are read
for any of several mistakes::

1.  any differences in mapping
2.  a difference in scale
3.  a difference in image rotation with respect to North
4.  an error of offset, the images must butt together geographically
    exactly as they are concatenated in the image sense.
    
If any of these errors occur, the program aborts with an appropriate
error message.

A correct GeoTIFF label is attached to the output (it will be a copy
of the first (leftmost) input since its offset is (1,1) in the VICAR
pixel referencing system.

If a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/gtmss_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> parameter is used, it applies to all of the input images.

EXECUTION:

Example

gtmss <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/gtmss_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=(A,B,C) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/gtmss_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=D  will put images A, B, and C side-by-side to form D.

OPERATION:
gtmss combines datasets in the following manner:  
Each line is made up of the corresponding input lines laid end to end in
a concatenated manner.  That is, the first pixel of each input is placed
to the right of the last pixel of the previous input.  The line thus
formed will have the same number of samples per line as the sum of the
inputs. (If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/gtmss_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> field is used, it will be <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/gtmss_level2.html#ns">NS</A> * #-inputs.)

The program uses dynamic allocation of buffers in the C programming
language, so truly colossal images can be combined (for example, an
output image of 30 x 10,000,000) would not be a problem.

 TIMING: 

As fast as VICAR can read and write the lines.
