Number of tiepoints in the near vicinity of each tiepoint to use in
a least squares fit to predict that tiepoint from it's neighbors.
Must be between 4 and 20.

<A NAME="length"><H3>LENGTH</H3></A><pre>
The maximum vector <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> permitted. Any vector longer than this is rejected.

<A NAME="angle"><H3>ANGLE</H3></A><pre>
Maximum permitted <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#angle">angle</A> deviation between the tiepoint vector and
the vector predicted from the neighboring tiepoint vectors.
In degrees.
       If Ar is the vector <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#angle">angle</A> and Ap is the predicted
       <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#angle">angle</A> then the tiepoint is deleted if:

Maximum permitted <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> deviation between the tiepoint vector and
the vector predicted from the neighboring tiepoint vectors.
This is a ratio between 0 and 1.
       If Lr is the  vector <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> and Lp is the predicted
       <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> then the tiepoint is deleted if:
       abs(Lr-Lp)/(Lr+Lp+<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>) &gt <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A> protects short vectors from being deleted. It should be set to
about the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> of the shortest vectors which one considers to begin
to be immune from testing. 
For purposes of geoms or morphing a vector of nearly zero <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#length">length</A> does no harm.
Such a short vector really points nowhere and it's <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core470/html/vichelp/tptedt2_level2.html#angle">angle</A> is meaningless. You
generally want to keep it.

The default is to delete the tiepoint if either check fails.
