<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
There are two options for describing input images.

Either:
List the image file names

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
1  Output image containing the mosaic.
2  Output overlap text file. Format:
record 1: number of images N in this overlap region.
record 2: N integers (image numbers, 1 based) N floats (the intensities).
record 3: number of images N in this overlap region.
record 4: N integers (image numbers, 1 based) N floats (the intensities).
...
 two records per overlap set.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="projection"><H3>PROJECTION</H3></A><pre>
The output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#projection">projection</A> type. 
Options include CYLINDRICAL (the default), POLAR, and VERTICAL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zoom"><H3>ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for the image.  This is a shortcut to computing and
specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A>.  A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of 2 will make the image twice
as big as it "naturally" wants to be (or twice as big as the specified
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A>/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A>).  A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of .25 will make it one quarter the "natural"
size.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The BSQ input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#band">band</A> number. Defaults to 1

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="input_range"><H3>INPUT_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The range of inputs to actually mosaic.  Normally all inputs are mosaicked.
However, if this parameter is specified, all inputs will be used to calculate
the output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#projection">projection</A>, but only the inputs in the specified range will be
mosaicked.  This allows the generation of a large mosaic to be spread <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#out">out</A>
over several nodes on a network, with a program like FASTMOS used to combine
all the outputs together.  Note that any underlays (annotation that goes
under the image) should be put on the *last* mosaic only for FASTMOS;
overlays (that show on top of everything) should be on all images (or at
least the first).

The input numbers are 1-based.  If only one number is specified, it is the
starting number; the end defaults to the # of inputs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bias"><H3>BIAS</H3></A><pre>
Specifies values to multiply DN values of each input
picture. Defaults to 1.0 for each picture. For example, 
if there are five input images, then try
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>=(1.0, 1.33, 0.8, 1.90, 1.0)

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A> is obsolete now; it has been replaced by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="brtcorr"><H3>BRTCORR</H3></A><pre>
Specifies an input file containing brightness corrections.  This is an
XML file that comes from a program like marsbrt which contains correction
factors for each image.  These factors may be additive or multiplicative
constants to be applied to the image, or other corrections that may be
implemented in the future.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> mechanism is intended to replace <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.  Using them together
should be avoided because the labels will not reflect both (the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>
overrides).  If you do, however, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> corrections are applied to
the data first, before <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
The output mosaic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">scale</A> in pixels/degree.  Defaults to the natural scale
of the camera.  This natural <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">scale</A> is printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#out">out</A> for reference.
NOTE:  THIS IS FOR CYLINDRICAL AND POLAR ONLY.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A> for Vertical
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="leftaz"><H3>LEFTAZ</H3></A><pre>
Azimuth of the left edge of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
smallest azimuth of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rightaz"><H3>RIGHTAZ</H3></A><pre>
Azimuth of the right edge of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
largest azimuth of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="topel"><H3>TOPEL</H3></A><pre>
Elevation of the top of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
largest elevation of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Used for both Cylindrical and Polar (unlike the other az/el limits).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bottomel"><H3>BOTTOMEL</H3></A><pre>
Elevation of the bottom of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
smallest elevation of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="proj_origin"><H3>PROJ_ORIGIN</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the center of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.  This is an XYZ point from which
all of the azimuth/elevation rays emanate.  It defaults to the average
of all the input camera locations.
Cylindrical, Polar only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="up_az"><H3>UP_AZ</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the azimuth at the top of the image.  This has the effect of
rotating the image, with the given azimuth being straight up.
Polar only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="vert_scale"><H3>VERT_SCALE</H3></A><pre>
The output mosaic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">scale</A> in meters/pixel for Vertical projections only.
(See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> for Cylindrical and Polar).  There is no "natural" default
for this parameter, so it arbitrarily defaults to .01 meters/pixel.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxx"><H3>MAXX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in the X direction
(up, or north).  The picture height is from -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A> to +MAXX.
Defaults to 5 meters.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxy"><H3>MAXY</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in the Y direction
(right, or east).  The picture width is from -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A> to +MAXY.
Defaults to 5 meters.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid"><H3>GRID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of grid to use.  Valid values are:

NOGRID - No grid is generated
GRID - A grid is generated "underneath" the image, so it shows only where
    there is no image
GRID_OVERLAY - A grid is generated "on top of" the image, so it shows
    everywhere.
GRID_LABELS - Plots the numbers and text only, without the grid lines.
    Useful when combined with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#input_range">INPUT_RANGE</A>.

The grid consists of azimuth/elevation lines (Cylindrical, Polar), or
X/Y lines (Vertical) and labels for each line along the edges (down from
the center for Polar Elevation).

The default is GRID.

See also GRID_SPACING, GRID_DN, and GRID_ZOOM.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_spacing"><H3>GRID_SPACING</H3></A><pre>

Overrides the spacing of the grid lines.  Both sets of lines use the
same value (i.e. azimuth and elevation can't be different).  See the GRID
keyword.

Defaults to 10 degrees for Cylindrical and Polar, and 1 meter for Vertical.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_dn"><H3>GRID_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the grid and grid labels.  See GRID keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_zoom"><H3>GRID_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor to use for the grid labels (i.e. how big the text is).
Must be a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible.  See the GRID keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the
stereo cameras. The two options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY which means no surface
is used or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface =PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters.  For the cases when PLANE
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">surface</A>,
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number"><H3>NUMBER</H3></A><pre>
Causes the program to place an ASCII number into the mosaic at the center of
where each input picture falls.  Numbers begin at 1 and increase in the
order of the filenames in the input.  This permits one to determine which
picture populated which part of the mosaic.  Defaults to NONUMBER.

The DN to use for the numbers is set by NUMBER_DN, and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for
the numbers by NUMBER_ZOOM.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_dn"><H3>NUMBER_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the image numbers.  See NUMBER keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_zoom"><H3>NUMBER_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor to use for the image numbers (i.e. how big the numbers are).
Must be a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible.  See NUMBER keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_start"><H3>NUMBER_START</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the starting point for the image numbers (i.e. the first input is
assigned this number for the image number overlays, and they increment from
there).  Normally this will be 1, but could be set differently if only part
of a larger mosaic is being generated.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="footprt"><H3>FOOTPRT</H3></A><pre>
Causes "footprints" to be drawn around each input image in the output
mosaic.  This is useful to show overlap of the images, and is often used
in conjunction with NUMBER.

There are three values:

NOFOOTPRINT - No footprint is displayed.  This is the default.
FOOTPRINT - Shows the footprint only where the edge of the image is "on top".
    Useful to see which image is laid down first.  If the DN (FOOT_DN) has
    insufficient contrast, the footprint may not be very visible, since it
    is interpolated like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#normal">normal</A> pixels.
OVERLAP - shows the entire footprints of all images, even if another image
    overlaps the edge of the input.  Useful to see how much overlap there is
    between images.  OVERLAP <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#mode">mode</A> will slow down the program down somewhat,
    since the borders are drawn in after the mosaic is created (to ensure that
    all borders are drawn).

The DN to use for the footprints is set by FOOT_DN.  Note that the footprint
replaces (hides) the outer row of pixels in the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="foot_dn"><H3>FOOT_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the footprints.  See FOOTPRT keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rad"><H3>RAD</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that turns on or off radiometric correction of the input
images.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#rad">RAD</A> (the default) enables the correction (for missions/instruments
which support it), while NORAD disables it.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale"><H3>DNSCALE</H3></A><pre>
DN scaling factor.  This factor is used to convert between physical
radiometric units (watts/(meter**2, steradian, micron)) and DN's for the
output mosaic.  The formula is:

true_radiance = offset + (factor * DN)

where "offset" is 0.0 in the current implementation, and "factor" is
1.0 / <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A> (making the formula equivalently:  offset + (DN / DNSCALE)).
The offset and factor (1.0/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A>) are written to the output mosaic label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
MARSMAP can operate in one of two modes.  The first is the traditional
method (INCREMENTAL), where each line is written to the mosaic output
file as it is processed.  The second (MEMORY) is the default; it stores
the entire mosaic in memory and writes it to the file only when it is
complete.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="interp"><H3>INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that turns on or off interpolation of the output
images pixel values.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#interp">INTERP</A> (the default) enables the interpolation, 
while NOINTERP disables it.

MEMORY <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#mode">mode</A> (the default) is somewhat faster (perhaps 10%, although
that's highly variable), and is required if doing parallel processing.
However, the memory requirements could become prohibitive for large
mosaics.

INCREMENTAL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is slower, but has the advantage of being able to view
the mosaic as it is being generated.  An image viewer such as xvd can be
used to monitor the progress of the mosaic.  By reloading periodically,
one can do quality control while a long mosaic is in progress.  Also,
the memory requirements are drastically lower in this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="horizon"><H3>HORIZON</H3></A><pre>
Provides a way to eliminate the sky from consideration during brightness
matching.  Normally the entire input image is used to calculate the overlaps.
However, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#horizon">HORIZON</A> allows you to specify an elevation (in degrees) above which
the brightness statistics are not gathered, effectively removing the sky.

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for all input parameters and output values,
and the mosaic itself.  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsint_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system. These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
