<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
There are two options for describing input images.
 
Either:
List the image file names
 
Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rinp">RINP</A> is used, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A> contains the "left" set of images to mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output image containing the mosaic.

By default, the output will have the same <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands
as the input with the most bands, and all bands will be processed.  Inputs
with fewer than that many bands repeat their last <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A>, so bw and color images
can be mixed.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">BAND</A> is specified, the output will have a single band.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="idx_out"><H3>IDX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the index file.

The index file contains, for each pixel, a halfword integer (16 bit signed)
identifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> image the pixel came from.  0 indicates no value (black
in the mosaic).  Numbers from 1-n match the order of files in the input list
file (or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A> parameter, if a list file isn't given).  For most mosaics, the
file could be converted to byte using CFORM (half is used to support more
than 255 input files).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="icm_out"><H3>ICM_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the ICM file.

The ICM file is an Image Coregistration Map.  It is a two-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> float file
containing the line, sample coordinate of the input pixel used for the point.
This is the same basic format as correlation maps such as MARSCOR3 produces,
except that multiple images are involved (thus the need for the index file,
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#idx_out">IDX_OUT</A>).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rinp"><H3>RINP</H3></A><pre>
Similar to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A>, but contains the "right" set of images to mosaic.

This is optional; if not provided then the input should be in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A> and
consist of just one eye (either one).  However, it is highly recommended
to use the new <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rinp">RINP</A> mode.  See the main help.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The BSQ input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A>. Defaults to all bands in image, but will use
a value of 1 if an invalid <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> is specified. Providing a value will cause
only that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> to be processed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="which"><H3>WHICH</H3></A><pre>
Specifies whether a Left or Right mosaic is to be produced.  This is only
relevant when <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rinp">RINP</A> is provided.  Both <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A> and RINP participate in setting
the geometry; only <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A> is used for mosaicking with -LEFT, and only <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rinp">RINP</A> is
used for mosaicking with -RIGHT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="use_pointing"><H3>USE_POINTING</H3></A><pre>
Specifies using pointed camera models rather than calibration ones.  See
the main help.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="master_right"><H3>MASTER_RIGHT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies that the first image from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rinp">RINP</A> should be used to set the size of
pixels in the output mosaic, rather than the first image from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#inp">INP</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="input_range"><H3>INPUT_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The range of inputs to actually mosaic.  Normally all inputs are mosaicked.
However, if this parameter is specified, all inputs will be used to calculate
the output projection, but only the inputs in the specified range will be
mosaicked.  This allows the generation of a large mosaic to be spread <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A>
over several nodes on a network, with a program like FASTMOS used to combine
all the outputs together.  Note that any underlays (annotation that goes
under the image) should be put on the *last* mosaic only for FASTMOS;
overlays (that show on top of everything) should be on all images (or at
least the first).

The input numbers are 1-based.  If only one <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> is specified, it is the
starting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A>; the end defaults to the # of inputs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is
selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0, 0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A>
are defined.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of
the values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate
system.  Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is
using the same values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to
mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of validation process.  On the other hand specifying
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead to underlying code treating the input value as
invalid and reverting to default <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> is FIXED frame.  So the values for
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as found in the list of valid values
for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the
stereo cameras. The options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> means no surface
is used, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface = PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters.  For the cases when PLANE 
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection 
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, 
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same. Last, MESH is a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
model defined by a mesh file (.obj) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> path is given with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_mesh">SURF_MESH</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_mesh"><H3>SURF_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Mesh OBJ file to use as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model. For the mesh to be used,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> must be set to MESH. The coordinates of the mesh vertices can be 
expressed in any CS. However the mesh CS must be supplied via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A>.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> is not used, then the mesh is assumed to be to the CS that
results from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>

VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> 
File name of a vicar file whose CS (contained in the labels) will be read and
assigned to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> model. The type of image and its content are of no
interest, we are just reading the CS. That CS will supersede any other <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
CS definition (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>). Its typical use is to supply a CS to a
given mesh file (expectedly the XYZ from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> the mesh is computed from, but
doesn't have to). But <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> could be use to define a CS in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> 
and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> for a PLANE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> are expressed in.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bias"><H3>BIAS</H3></A><pre>
Specifies values to multiply DN values of each input
picture. Defaults to 1.0 for each picture. For example, 
if there are five input images, then try
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>=(1.0, 1.33, 0.8, 1.90, 1.0)

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A> is obsolete now; it has been replaced by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="brtcorr"><H3>BRTCORR</H3></A><pre>
Specifies an input file containing brightness corrections.  This is an
XML file that comes from a program like marsbrt <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> contains correction
factors for each image.  These factors may be additive or multiplicative
constants to be applied to the image, or other corrections that may be
implemented in the future.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> mechanism is intended to replace <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.  Using them together
should be avoided because the labels will not reflect both (the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>
overrides).  If you do, however, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> corrections are applied to
the data first, before <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="border"><H3>BORDER</H3></A><pre>
Additional <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#border">border</A> to add to output image height.  The height calculation is
approximate; this provides some padding.  Note that half the specified <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#border">border</A>
is added to each of the top and bottom.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="full_frm"><H3>FULL_FRM</H3></A><pre>
Selects full panorama (FULL_FRAME) or output sized to input (PARTIAL_FRAME)
in the azimuth (sample) direction.  Normally (PARTIAL_FRAME), the output
size is shrunk (in azimuth) to just fit the input images.  If FULL_FRAME
is specified, the output will be a full 360-degree panorama (whether or not
there is data to go in the extra space).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="start_az"><H3>START_AZ</H3></A><pre>
Override for azimuth of left edge of output.  Normally this is derived as
the minimum azimuth in the inputs (adjusted for 360-0 wraparound).
This value is specified using the coordinate frame in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> (default is
Fixed, or Site).  This allows control over the mosaic framing in terms
of north, i.e. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#start_az">start_az</A>=0 puts North at the edge of the mosaic.  START_AZ
can also be specified in instrument (Rover) frame, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> frames the mosaic
relative to the spacecraft.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="proj_el"><H3>PROJ_EL</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the elevation of the vertical center of projection (defaults to
half the image height).  The center of each column's output camera is defined
by the column in the azimuth direction, and by this value in the elevation
direction.  Note that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#proj_el">PROJ_EL</A> applies before the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#untilt">untilt</A> (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ring_axis">ring_axis</A>) rotation
is done.  This value is always specfied in instrument (Rover) coodinates.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="proj_line"><H3>PROJ_LINE</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the line <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> in the image that matches <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#proj_el">PROJ_EL</A>.  This has the
effect of shifting the entire mosaic up or down in the frame, without
changing the projection.  This value is normally calculated such that the
minimum and maximum elevations are at the top and bottom of the image,
respectively.

The actual formula is:
    tan(max_elev - <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#proj_el">PROJ_EL</A>) / camera_pixel_angle + <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#border">BORDER</A>/2
where camera_pixel_angle is the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> of radians per pixel in the vertical
direction for the first image's camera.

Note that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#proj_line">PROJ_LINE</A> applies before the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#untilt">untilt</A> (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ring_axis">ring_axis</A>) rotation is done.
After this rotation, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#proj_line">PROJ_LINE</A> actually follows a sinusoidal path across the
mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outsize"><H3>OUTSIZE</H3></A><pre>
Overrides size of the output image.  If specified, the setting of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#full_frm">FULL_FRM</A>
is ignored.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zoom"><H3>ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
Sets the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for the output mosaic.  The default 1.0 uses the size
as determined from the inputs (see -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#master_right">MASTER_RIGHT</A>).  A value of 2.0 would create
a mosaic 2x larger in each dimension, while 0.25 would create a mosaic 4x
smaller in each dimension.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>

Minimum sample <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> (azimuth column) to be projected.  Anything to the
left of this column is unprojected and will be black in the output, regardless

Maximum sample <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> (azimuth column) to be projected.  Anything to the

<hr>
<A NAME="baseline"><H3>BASELINE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter allows the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#baseline">baseline</A> between the virtual output cameras to be
adjusted.  It is the same as the diameter of the ring (or 2x the radius)
that is described by the output cameras as they move in azimuth.  Adjusting
this changes the separation between the eyes, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> results in more (larger
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#baseline">baseline</A>) or less (smaller baseline) depth between the foreground and
background.  It can be used to compensate for the large <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#baseline">baseline</A> of the MER
pancams (30cm), making it smaller and thus easier to view.

Note that this is specified as a diameter for convenience.  The image labels
contain the ring radius, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> is half this value.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#baseline">Baseline</A> adjustment works well when the actual <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> matches the surface
model.  Any deviation from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model can result in distortions due
to parallax effects.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ring_axis"><H3>RING_AXIS</H3></A><pre>
This parameter allows adjustment of the axis of the ring described by the
output cameras.  The effect is to "tilt" the mosaic in some direction.  The
value should be a unit vector, expressed in the Instrument (Rover) frame.

This parameter should rarely be used directly; the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#untilt">UNTILT</A> parameter sets it
to an appropriate value.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ring_center"><H3>RING_CENTER</H3></A><pre>
This parameter allows adjustment of the center point of the ring described
by the output cameras.  This is also the pivot point for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ring_axis">RING_AXIS</A> rotation.
The effect of changing this is unclear and it should rarely if ever be used.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="untilt"><H3>UNTILT</H3></A><pre>
This flag, if set, adjusts <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#ring_axis">RING_AXIS</A> to "level" or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#untilt">untilt</A> the spacecraft,
making the horizon level while retaining proper disparity.

Untilting works well when the actual <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> matches the surface model.
Any deviation from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model can result in distortions due to
parallax effects.

.PARM <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#disp_pix">DISP_PIX</A>
This parameter shifts the mosaic left or right by the specified <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> of
pixels.  It is used to control overall disparity (moving the entire mosaic
in or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A> in depth) by changing the value between the left and right eyes.
Internally, this just adjusts the value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#start_az">START_AZ</A>; this parameter is more
convenient to use however as you don't need to know what <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#start_az">START_AZ</A> would
otherwise be and do the math to adjust it.  Also, since it is measured in
pixels instead of degrees, it is easier to use for disparity adjustment.

Coordinate system of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A> input. This is helpful if you would like to define
a wrapping location in a coordinate system different than your other mosaic parameters.
An example of this functionality would be wrapping in the rover frame at <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A>=180      
(back of the rover) to move the rover hardware to the edges of the mosaic.

<A NAME="number"><H3>NUMBER</H3></A><pre>
Causes the program to place an ASCII <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> into the mosaic at the center of
where each input picture falls.  Numbers begin at 1 and increase in the
order of the filenames in the input.  This permits one to determine <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A>
picture populated <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> part of the mosaic.  Defaults to NONUMBER.

The DN to use for the numbers is set by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number_dn">NUMBER_DN</A>, and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for

<A NAME="number_dn"><H3>NUMBER_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the image numbers.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> keyword.  Note, a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number_dn">NUMBER_DN</A> of 0 is transparent (i.e. ignored).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_zoom"><H3>NUMBER_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor to use for the image numbers (i.e. how big the numbers are).
Must be a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_start"><H3>NUMBER_START</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the starting point for the image numbers (i.e. the first input is
assigned this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> for the image number overlays, and they increment from
there).  Normally this will be 1, but could be set differently if only part
of a larger mosaic is being generated.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="footprt"><H3>FOOTPRT</H3></A><pre>
Causes "footprints" to be drawn around each input image in the output
mosaic.  This is useful to show overlap of the images, and is often used
in conjunction with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A>.

There are three values:

NOFOOTPRINT - No footprint is displayed.  This is the default.
FOOTPRINT - Shows the footprint only where the edge of the image is "on top".
    Useful to see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> image is laid down first.  If the DN (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>) has
    insufficient contrast, the footprint may not be very visible, since it
    is interpolated like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#normal">normal</A> pixels.
OVERLAP - shows the entire footprints of all images, even if another image
    overlaps the edge of the input.  Useful to see how much overlap there is
    between images.  OVERLAP mode will slow down the program down somewhat,
    since the borders are drawn in after the mosaic is created (to ensure that
    all borders are drawn).

The DN to use for the footprints is set by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>.  Note that the footprint
replaces (hides) the outer row of pixels in the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="foot_dn"><H3>FOOT_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the footprints.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#footprt">FOOTPRT</A> keyword.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A> is an array, allowing color footprints to be created.  Each element
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A> is used in sequence for the corresponding <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A>.  If not enough
elements are present in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>, the last value is repeated.  A value of 0
is treated as transparent, i.e. that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> is not touched by the footprint.

So for a color mosaic with range 0-4095, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>=4095 will plot footprints in
white, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>=\(1,4095,4095\) will plot them in cyan, and
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>=\(0,4095,4095\) will plot them in something between cyan and white,
dependeing on the image content of the first <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A>.  Note that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A> is a
floating point <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A>, so <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>=\(0.1,4095,4095\) on an integer image will
put a true 0 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A> for the red <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#band">band</A> without triggering the transparency check.

<hr>
<A NAME="rad"><H3>RAD</H3></A><pre>
Keyword paramter that selects radiometric correction mode of the input images.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rad">RAD</A> (the default) enables the correction (for missions/instruments <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> support
it); NORAD disables it; ZENITH_SCALED_RAD the radiometry you'd get if the sun
were at zenith on a clear day.  The scaling factor is a combination of solar
elevation and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#tau">tau</A>, and will have the effect of brightening up images that
were taken near sunset.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale"><H3>DNSCALE</H3></A><pre>
DN scaling factor.  This factor is used to convert between physical
radiometric units (watts/(meter**2, steradian, micron)) and DN's for the
output mosaic.  The formula is:

true_radiance = offset + (factor * DN)

where "offset" is 0.0 in the current implementation, and "factor" is
1.0 / <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A> (making the formula equivalently:  offset + (DN / DNSCALE)).
The offset and factor (1.0/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A>) are written to the output mosaic label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale_in"><H3>DNSCALE_IN</H3></A><pre>
Three-state keyword parameter to control whether or not to apply scaling
parameters to reconstruct floating point values.

RESCALE says to do the conversion, and reconstitute the float based on the
RADIANCE_* keywords.  Note that if there are no RADIANCE_* keywords,
this is a no-op, so it doesn't hurt to turn this on for non-scaled images.

NOSCALE says to not to the conversion.  This is what we do now.  If your
inputs are dynamically scaled, you'll probably get surprising results.

AUTOSCALE says to figure it <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A> based on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> parameter (see
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> for details) and -ZENITH_SCALED_RAD flag. If DNSCALE_OUT is STATIC,
then it is NOSCALE; if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> is DYNAMIC/IDENTIT or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rad">RAD</A>=ZENITH_SCALED_RAD,
then it is RESCALE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale_out"><H3>DNSCALE_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Three-state keywork parameter to scale output DN values.

If -STATIC is enabled, then the value specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A> will be used
as the DN scaling factor (note the unit scaling factor as well) for all
radiometric models supplied.

If -DYNAMIC is enabled, then the maximum responsivity value across all
radiometric models will be used as the DN scaling factor (note the unit
scaling factor as well).

If -IDENTITY is enabled, then no scaling will be applied.

Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="interp"><H3>INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that turns on or off interpolation of the output

Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#start_az">START_AZ</A> only.
The interpretation of the values is dependent on the mission.  Some
representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A>
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> never
moved, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#number">number</A> (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsmcauley_level2.html#which">which</A> solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
