<pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>A required double-band, real-valued VICAR image of disparity values.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>An XML text file representing a set of tiepoints.

<A NAME="rhs"><H3>RHS</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>A required EDR or RDR type file corresponding to the disparity image.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>Each input disparity image must have a RHS to determine the unique ID
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>for each disparity map. Only the RHS labels are used, so either EDR 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>or RDR files can be used.

<A NAME="xyz"><H3>XYZ</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>An optional xyz file used to discard tp that do not have valid xyz
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>data. If there are less xyz files than disparity files, then the n xyz
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>files will be associated in order with the first n disparity files.

<hr>
<A NAME="inptie"><H3>INPTIE</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>An optional XML text file representing a set of tiepoints. If
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>provided, any cnt parameter will be ignored, and the inptie file will
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>be used to select tiepoints for generation. If there are less inptie
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>files than disparity files, then the n inptie files will be associated
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>in order with the first n disparity files.

<hr>
<A NAME="cnt"><H3>CNT</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>The approximate number of tiepoints to be generated, ignored if inptie
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>is provided. If INPTIE is not provided, then CNT is used to generate a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>line/sample sampling frequency such that approximately CNT tiepoints
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>are generated. The tiepoints are selected with approximately uniform
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>2-d spacing. The linear sampling frequency is approximately
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>sqrt(NL*NS/CNT). However, selected tiepoints are discarded when the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>disparity value is undefined. Tiepoints also are discarded when an
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>optional XYZ file is provided and the XYZ is undefined.  For example,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>the test cases ask for 100 points but get only 28 without an XYZ file,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>and 21 with an XYZ file.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>Used to select output tiepoint type. Valid choices are TRADITIONAL and
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>MISS_DISTANCE.  The tiepoint data are the same, but this type
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>distinction directs marsnav to calculate error in different ways.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>With TRADITIONAL, the error is based on line/sample differences in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>image space.  With MISS_DISTANCE, the error is based on the distance
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>in xyz space between the rays to the left and right tiepoints, as
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/disp2tp_level2.html"></A>calculated by xvector.
