There are two options for describing input images.

Either:
List the image file names

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

The input images can be 1-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">band</A> or multi-band. The input images must be 
co-registered to the images provided in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A> parameter.

<p>

<A NAME="in_xyz"><H3>IN_XYZ</H3></A><pre>
There are two options for describing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A>.

Either:
List the image file names

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

The input images must be 3-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">band</A> in REAL (float) format. The bands are in x, y, z
order. The input images must be co-registered to the images provided in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#inp">INP</A> 
parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output image contains the ORTHO mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out_dem"><H3>OUT_DEM</H3></A><pre>
Output image contains the DEM mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="img_nodata"><H3>IMG_NODATA</H3></A><pre>
Defines what value to be used for the no data areas in ORTHO output. The 
default value is 0.0. The value is going to be used as a flag to distinguish
whether a position has a valid data or not, so the value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#img_nodata">IMG_NODATA</A> is better
be set outside the image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dem_nodata"><H3>DEM_NODATA</H3></A><pre>
Defines what value to be used for the no data areas in DEM output. The
default value is the maximum floating point number, which is 3.40282E+38.
The value is going to be used as a flag to distinguish whether a position 
has a valid value or not, so the value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#dem_nodata">DEM_NODATA</A> is better be set 
outside the image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fill_size"><H3>FILL_SIZE</H3></A><pre>
Defines the size in pixel for fill implementation. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fill_factor"><H3>FILL_FACTOR</H3></A><pre>
Defines the factor to enlarge or reduce filled squares. For example, if a 
filled square has size=5, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fill_factor">FILL_FACTOR</A>=2, the resultant filled square 
will have size=9. new_size = ((old_size - 1) / 2) * <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fill_factor">FILL_FACTOR</A> * 2 + 1.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fill_method"><H3>FILL_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Defines the method for fill implementation. UNIFORM mode fills pixels with a 
uniformed size defined by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fill_size">FILL_SIZE</A>. WEIGHTED mode fills pixels using camera 
resolution. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_angle"><H3>MAX_ANGLE</H3></A><pre>
Defines the maximum pixel angle in radians. It is roughly 89 degress. It is used
to safe guard pixel angles so that they won't exceed 90 degrees (tan(90) 
approaches to positive infinity). In general, this value should not be modified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_span"><H3>MAX_SPAN</H3></A><pre>
Defines the maximum span (in pixels) for the WEIGHTED mode.  The span can get
unreasonably large near the horizon.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pixel_angle"><H3>PIXEL_ANGLE</H3></A><pre>
Normally the pixel angle comes from the camera model. This parameter allows the 
angle to be overridden. If the input file does not have a camera model, this 
parameter is mandatory. If the specified value is greater than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#max_angle">MAX_ANGLE</A>, 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#max_angle">MAX_ANGLE</A> will be used in the calculations. Consider using the following
values:

InSight:
ICC: 2.1e-3
IDC: 0.82e-3
 
MER:
Pancam: 0.27e-3
Navcam: 0.77e-3
Hazcam: 2.0e-3
 
MSL:
Hazcam: 2.1e-3
Navcam: 0.82e-3
Mastcam left eye: 0.22e-3
Mastcam right eye: 0.074e-3
MAHLI: 0.3e-3 ~ 0.34e-3 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dem_fill"><H3>DEM_FILL</H3></A><pre>
Override <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fill_size">FILL_SIZE</A> for DEM output.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="range"><H3>RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Specifying a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A> will override the automatically determined min/max x/y,
so for example saying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A>=50 will set the output to +/- 50 meters in
both directions. This can be overridden by the specific MIN/MAX X/Y parameters.

If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is given and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">CUT</A> is not, the default for CUT is to cut a circle
at the same size of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cut"><H3>CUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the size of the circle/sawtooth shape (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut_type">CUT_TYPE</A>) at which to 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> the data, as a 2D distance from the coordinate system origin or a 3D 
distance from camera. If the value is 0, no <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> is performed (i.e. the output 
goes to the corners of the rectangle). If the value is undefined, the value of 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is used.

Thus specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>=50 will set the size of the image to +/-50 meters
and do a circular <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> at 50m distance.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>=50 CUT=40 will set the image
to 50 meters in size but <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> all data at 40m (thus leaving missing data
around the circle).  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>=50 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">CUT</A>=0 will set the image to 50 meter range
but not <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> in a circle.  CUT=50 will not set the size of the image (it
comes instead from the auto min/max x/y, parameters, or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A>), but it will
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#cut">cut</A> a circle at 50m.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cut_type"><H3>CUT_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
CIRCLE = 2d distance from coordinate system origin, results in circular image.  
SAWTOOTH = 3d distance from camera (each camera), results in sawtooth pattern 
for typical mast-mounted camera panoramas since the camera origin changes with
each image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The BSQ input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">band</A> number. Defaults to undefined. The parameter defines
which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">band</A>(s) in skin images will be processed to put in ORTHO output mosaic.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">BAND</A>=N, then only that band in skin images will be processed. If BAND is 
left to be undefined, then all bands in skin images will be processed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="minx"><H3>MINX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the minimum extent of the image in meters in the X direction. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#minx">MINX</A> 
is undefined, the program computes the minimum x value from the XYZ data 
provided with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A> parameter. If parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is provided, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#minx">MINX</A> is 
overriden by -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxx"><H3>MAXX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in the X direction. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A>
is undefined, the program computes the maximum x value from the XYZ data
provided with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A> parameter. If parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is provided, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A> is
overriden by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="miny"><H3>MINY</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the minimum extent of the image in meters in Y direction. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#miny">MINY</A>
is undefined, the program computes the minimum y value from the XYZ data
provided with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A> parameter. If parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is provided, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#miny">MINY</A> is
overriden by -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxy"><H3>MAXY</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in Y direction. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A>
is undefined, the program computes the maximum y value from the XYZ data
provided with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#in_xyz">IN_XYZ</A> parameter. If parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> is provided, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A> is
overriden by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">scale</A> for both DEM and ORTHO output mosaic, it is measured in meters per 
pixel. If it is defined, the mosaic will be set exactly at that resolution.
If it is undefined, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> will be computed based on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#minx">MINX</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A>. Either
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A> needs to be provided for the program to compute output's geometry.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale_thresh"><H3>SCALE_THRESH</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> is computed from Extent and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A> params, and the computed value exceeds values
specified by this parameter, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> will be set to the value of this parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="overlay"><H3>OVERLAY</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that provides 6 different methods of handling <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#overlay">overlay</A> areas
in DEM and ortho output mosaic. It defaults to method FIRST.
1. CLOSEST = closest to camera.
   When multiple points hit the same position, the one that is the closest to
   the camera will be picked and written in the output mosaic. This method 
   should give the best result if input XYZ data contains lesser noise.

2. AVG = average.
   When multiple points hit the same position, the average value of the points 
   will be picked and written in the output mosaic.
    
3. MIN = minimum.
   When multiple points hit the same position, the minimum value of the points 
   will be picked and written in output mosaic. 

4. MAX = maximum.
   When multiple points hit the same position, the maximum value of the points 
   will be picked and written in output mosaic.

5. FIRST = first on top.
   If this mode is enabled, depending on the images order in the input list,
   the points from images on top of the input list will have higher priorities 
   to be picked and written in the output mosaic. For example, given the 
   input list to be in the order of img1, img2, and img3, points come from img1 
   will be picked when there are overlap areas between img1 and img2; points 
   come from img2 will be picked when there are overlap areas between img2 and 
   img3.   

6. LAST = bottom on top.
   If this mode is enabled, depending on the images order in the input list,
   the points from images on bottom of the input list will have higher 
   priorities to be picked and written in the output mosaic. For example, given 
   the input list to be in the order of img1, img2, and img3, points come from 
   img2 will be picked when there are overlap areas between img1 and img2; 
   points come from img3 will be picked when there are overlap areas between 
   img2 and img3.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="camera_center"><H3>CAMERA_CENTER</H3></A><pre>
Normally the camera position comes from the camera model in the label.
This parameter allows the position to be overridden.  If the input file
does not have a camera model, this parameter is mandatory.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rad"><H3>RAD</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that turns on or off radiometric correction of the input 
images. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#rad">RAD</A> (the default) enables the correction (for missions/instruments which
support it), while NORAD disables it. For input images which are in REAL(float) 
format, radiometric correction is disabled. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="brtcorr"><H3>BRTCORR</H3></A><pre>
Specifies an input file containing brightness corrections.  This is an
XML file that comes from a program like marsbrt which contains correction
factors for each image.  These factors may be additive or multiplicative
constants to be applied to the image, or other corrections that may be
implemented in the future.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="input_range"><H3>INPUT_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A> of inputs to actually mosaic.  Normally all inputs are mosaicked.
However, if this parameter is specified, all inputs will be used to calculate
the output projection, but only the inputs in the specified <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A> will be
mosaicked.

The input numbers are 1-based.  If only one number is specified, it is the
starting number; the end defaults to the # of inputs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="morphologic"><H3>MORPHOLOGIC</H3></A><pre>
Flag to enable erosion feature. If it is on, then the program will erode the
borders of generated DEM and ORTHO results. Note that the erosion will feature
will erode all the holes in DEM and ORTHO results.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="erode_shape"><H3>ERODE_SHAPE</H3></A><pre>
Structuring element shape for erosion feature. Currently, two default shapes
SQUARE and DIAMOND are provided. Using different structuring element shape
will cause the program to erode borders and holes differently.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="erode_factor"><H3>ERODE_FACTOR</H3></A><pre>
Defines how much to erode borders and holes.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="z_direction"><H3>Z_DIRECTION</H3></A><pre>
Defines the direction of Z-axis. It only applies to DEM output specified by 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#out_dem">OUT_DEM</A> parameter. By default, positive Z is pointing down. Setting ZUP will 
make positive Z up. For MER, use ZDOWN to generate the height maps.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
Number of Lines for both DEM and ORTHO output mosaic. If it is defined, the
number of lines of the mosaic will be set exactly to that number. If it is 
undefined, it is computed based on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#minx">MINX</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A>. Either <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A> or SCALE
needs to provided for the program to compute output's geometry.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl_thresh"><H3>NL_THRESH</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> is computed from Extent and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A> params, and the computed value exceeds values
specified by this parameter, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> will be set to the value of this parameter and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A>
will be recomputed.  If recomputed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl">NL</A> value exceeds the value of this parameter, it 
will be set to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#nl_thresh">NL_THRESH</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="idx_out"><H3>IDX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the index file.

The index file contains, for each pixel, a halfword integer (16 bit signed)
identifying which image the pixel came from.  0 indicates no value (black
in the mosaic).  Numbers from 1-n match the order of files in the input list
file (or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#inp">INP</A> parameter, if a list file isn't given).  For most mosaics, the
file could be converted to byte using CFORM (half is used to support more
than 255 input files).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="icm_out"><H3>ICM_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the ICM file.

The ICM file is an Image Coregistration Map.  It is a two-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#band">band</A> float file
containing the line, sample coordinate of the input pixel used for the point.
This is the same basic format as correlation maps such as MARSCOR3 produces,
except that multiple images are involved (thus the need for the index file,
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#idx_out">IDX_OUT</A>).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be

loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for all input parameters and output values,
and the mosaic itself. The interpretation of the values is dependent on 
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame.  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - (default) The "natural" frame for the instrument 
    (of the first input image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).  For MSL, this is the
    Rover Nav frame.
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.
RMECH - for MSL, this is the Rover Mechanical frame.  It should not normally
    be used except for testing.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="z_coord"><H3>Z_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Coordinate system to use for Z values in DEM. It is similar to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter, 
but it applies only to the Z values in DEM. If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#z_coord">Z_COORD</A> is specified, it 
overrides the coordinate system specified with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> for Z values in DEM. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="write_coord"><H3>WRITE_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies an additional coordinate system to write to the label.  The
coordinate system is not otherwise used.  The use case is to make sure that
the Rover coordinate system is written to a label when only Site frame XYZ's
and Site frame projection coordinates are used, so the output can be used
as input to the InSight instrument placement programs, some of which expect
a rover frame.  Not needed if either the skin or the projection coordinate
is rover.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#range">range</A> rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsortho_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing using OMP, which uses multiple cores on
a single host machine.  The default is on.  The help for e.g. marsmap
describes some environment variables that can further control parallel
processing.  Note that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built
in to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP
documentation.
