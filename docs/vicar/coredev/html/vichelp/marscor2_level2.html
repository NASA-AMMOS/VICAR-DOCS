<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
First left eye image, then right eye image.

There is nothing actually requiring left/right order, other than convention.
If left/right is unclear (e.g. the images are not from a stereo camera) then
either order is acceptable.  If the output is used with MARSXYZ, the same
order must be used.

<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
The line and sample disparity files.  If one filename is given, a two-banded
file is created with line disparity as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#band">band</A> 1 and sample disparity as band 2.
If two filenames are given, two single-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#band">band</A> files are created.  Line disparity
is in file 1, and sample disparity is in file 2.

See the main program help for output file contents and formatting.

<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mask"><H3>MASK</H3></A><pre>
Optional output file showing the coverage of tiepoints (correlated pixels),
in BYTE format.
 0 dn means the pixel could not be reached in order to be correlated.
   (i.e. there were no neighbors to supply an initial value, or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#tptlimit">TPTLIMIT</A>
   was reached).
 128 dn means a correlation was successfully performed at this location.
 255 dn means a correlation was attempted at this location but it failed,
   usually because of low correlation <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out_quality"><H3>OUT_QUALITY</H3></A><pre>
Output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> file (optional): A REAL image containing the correlation
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> of each pixel attempted, from 0 to 1.  0 indicates either a
correlation failure unrelated to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">QUALITY</A> setting, or a pixel that was
not reached (the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mask">MASK</A> output can distinguish).  Note that the file will
contain just a thin border of poor-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> pixels around each area,
because poor-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> pixels prevent the correlator from searching farther
in that direction.

This file could be used in conjunction with a very low <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> setting
to allow correlation in low-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> areas, with the result filtered
afterwards using a higher <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A> (i.e. use the output quality file as
a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mask">mask</A>).  However, this is somewhat dangerous, especially if there is
any kind of repeating pattern in the image - the correlator could get
"stuck" on the wrong match for the pattern.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The vicar image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#band">band</A> number for the input images.  Defaults to 1

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="template"><H3>TEMPLATE</H3></A><pre>
Correlation size.  Must be an odd number.  Defaults to 15 square.

If only one value is given, a square <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">template</A> is used.  If two values are
given, the first is the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">template</A> height (line direction) and the second is
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">template</A> width (sample direction).  Rectangular templates that are
wider than they are tall should be useful for lander images.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="search"><H3>SEARCH</H3></A><pre>
Correlation <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> area.  Must be an odd number.  Defaults to 35 square.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> must be &gt <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">TEMPLATE</A>.  If SEARCH is only a bit larger than TEMPLATE
then many correlations will abort because they will be prohibited from
searching in promising directions. 

If only one value is given, a square <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> area is used.  If two values are
given, the first is the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> height (line direction) and the second is
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> width (sample direction).  Rectangular search areas that are
wider than they are tall should be useful for lander images.

Note that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> is not used for seed points, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#amax">AMAX</A>(2) is.  However, the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">TEMPLATE</A> parameter *is* used for seed points.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="quality"><H3>QUALITY</H3></A><pre>
Minimum acceptable correlation <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">quality</A>.  Correlations with qualities below
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#quality">QUALITY</A> will be rejected. Qualities range from 0 (poor) to 1 (excellent).
Defaults to 0.6  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tptlimit"><H3>TPTLIMIT</H3></A><pre>
Limit number of tiepoints to the first <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#tptlimit">TPTLIMIT</A> values.  Defaults to -1 which 
indicates that all points are to be acquired.  This limits the growth of
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> window around the seed point.  However, the gore-filling pass is
not constrained by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#tptlimit">TPTLIMIT</A>.

If there are multiple seed points, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#tptlimit">TPTLIMIT</A> represents an aggregate of all
correlated points, not ones derived from each seed point.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="amax"><H3>AMAX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">template</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> areas.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#amax">AMAX</A>(1) is not very useful,
but <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#amax">AMAX</A>(2) is used for seed point correlations as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> area (which is
always square).  An error is generated if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">TEMPLATE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> exceed the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#amax">AMAX</A> limits.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> of the gruen correlator to use.

All correlations are performed using the gruen correlation routine.  See
the gruen documentation for details of the algorithm.  Seed points are
always correlated using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 3 (linear followed by amoeba) to handle large
offsets.  The rest of the points may be correlated using any gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A>
via the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> parameter:

linear:            gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 0
annealing:         gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 1
amoeba:            gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 2
linear_amoeba:     gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 3
annealing_amoeba:  gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 4
amoeba2:           gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 5
linear_amoeba2:    gruen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 6

Of the above, only amoeba and amoeba2 (modes 2 and 5) are recommended.  The
others are provided only for experimentation, and may significantly increase
the execution time of the program.  The annealing modes are not fully
implemented in the code at this time, but it would be trivial to do so if
desired.

The amoeba <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> uses a full 6 degree of freedom <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> from the starting point
(derived from the best neighbor).  The starting point must be within 2 pixels.
The amoeba2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#mode">mode</A> uses only 2 degrees of freedom (x/y offsets only) so it will
be faster, at the possible expense of accuracy.  The starting point must also
be within 2 pixels.  amoeba2 is not recommended for images that are not derived
from a stereo camera, e.g. using different instruments or involving motion
between the two frames.  The other modes generally do not have a 2 pixels
starting point limitation, so they might be useful for scenes with wildly
varying disparity values.  However, they are so slow that it will usually be
better to supply multiple seed points in each area using MARSTIE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_trials"><H3>MAX_TRIALS</H3></A><pre>
As described under METHOD, the program starts with a seed point, expands as
much as possible from there, and then fills in gores.  If not enough tiepoints
have been gathered, it then repeats the entire process with a different
(random) seed.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#max_trials">MAX_TRIALS</A> specifies the maximum number of seed points (and
thus iterations) that can be performed by each CPU.

Note that this parameter also applies to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#second_pass">SECOND_PASS</A> done by the master
processor.

Default: 5

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fill_fraction"><H3>FILL_FRACTION</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fill_fraction">FILL_FRACTION</A> specifies how much of the image should be filled up with
tiepoints.  Each CPU will continue to pick new seed points and re-do the
correlation until either <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fill_fraction">FILL_FRACTION</A> is satisfied or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#max_trials">MAX_TRIALS</A> is
exhausted.

Note that this parameter also applies to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#second_pass">SECOND_PASS</A> done by the master
processor.

Default: .9

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="second_pass"><H3>SECOND_PASS</H3></A><pre>
After the parallel nodes have done their work, the results are collected
on the master node.  Sometimes there may be gaps between the tiles processed
by individual nodes (especially if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#segment_border">SEGMENT_BORDER</A> is used).  Activating
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#second_pass">SECOND_PASS</A> will cause the entire correlation algorithm to be run again on
the full image, which will tend to fill in gaps between the tiles.

Defaults to off.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="segment_border"><H3>SEGMENT_BORDER</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#segment_border">SEGMENT_BORDER</A> specifies the number of pixels that should be omitted from
consideration along the border of each node's tile.  A non-zero number here
will result in gaps between tiles, in which case the use of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#second_pass">SECOND_PASS</A> is
recommended.  Note that this affects the first, or reference, image only;
correlation matches can go anywhere in the second image.  This parameter
is rarely needed.

Default: 0

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outside_border"><H3>OUTSIDE_BORDER</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the number of pixels that are omitted around the outside edges
of the (first, or reference) image.  There is little point in attempting to
compute pixels which won't correlate because they're closer to the edge of
the image than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#template">template</A> window size.  This parameter can be used to trim
those <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#out">out</A>, resulting in some execution speedup.  Note that this affects the
first, or reference, image only; correlation matches can go anywhere in the
second image.

Default: 5

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rand_seed"><H3>RAND_SEED</H3></A><pre>
Seed points are derived using a random number generator (rand()).  In
order to generate repeatable results, the seed for the random number
generator may be provided via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#rand_seed">RAND_SEED</A>.  If the parameter is not given,
the seed is not set, and defaults to whatever the system sets.

If the parameter is given, srand() is called to set the seed.  If the
value is 0, time() is called to get a seed (this is the best "true" random
value).  Any other value will set the seed to that value.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you more accurate pointing.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the
stereo cameras. The two options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY which means no surface
is used or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface=PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters. For the cases when PLANE
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">surface</A>,
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#search">search</A> is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a program run using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for all input parameters and output values,
and the mosaic itself.  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marscor2_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
