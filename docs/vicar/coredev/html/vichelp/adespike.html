<H1>Help for ADESPIKE</H1>
<pre>
PURPOSE:

ADESPIKE will detect and remove single-pixel errors (spikes).  A pixel
is determined to be in error if it differs from its adjacent neighbors
by more than certain specifiable thresholds.  Pixel errors are replaced
by the average of adjacent pixels.

ADESPIKE was originally developed to remove random telemetry transmission
errors (bit-errors) from flight images.  However, the algorithm is
completely general and can be applied to any image containing random noise
affecting individual pixels.  Independent tests are applied in the horizontal
and vertical directions.  Consequently, ADESPIKE can also detect and remove
lines or columns one pixel in width which deviate significantly from
neighboring lines or columns (e.g. line drop-outs).

EXECUTION:

         ADESPIKE  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#inp">INP</A>  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#out">OUT</A>  user-parameters...
where
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#inp">INP</A> is the input image (byte or halfword).
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#out">OUT</A> is the output image.
The input image may be of arbitrary <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#size">size</A>.  The output image will be the
same data format as the input.

OPERATION:
  Let x0 be the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dn">DN</A> value of a given pixel, and let x1, x2, x3, and x4 be
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dn">DN</A> values of its neighbors:

                          x3
                       x1 x0 x2
                          x4

A horizontal test is first applied by comparing x0 with x1 and x2.  If x0
fails this test, it is replaced by the average of x1 and x2 and processing
continues (however, see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dn">DN</A> parameters below).  Otherwise a vertical
test is applied by comparing x0 with x3 and x4.  If x0 fails this test, it
is replaced by the average of x3 and x4 and processing continues.  Otherwise
x0 is accepted as a valid pixel.

The horizontal test is as follows:  Let avg=(x1+x2)/2.  Then x0 is in error
if:
                 x0 &lt A     or   B < x0
where
       A = min(avg-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#sltol">SLTOL</A>, x1-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dsltol">DSLTOL</A>, x2-DSLTOL)
       B = max(avg+<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#sutol">SUTOL</A>, x1+<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dsutol">DSUTOL</A>, x2+DSUTOL)
The thresholds <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#sltol">SLTOL</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#sutol">SUTOL</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dsltol">DSLTOL</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dsutol">DSUTOL</A> are specifiable parameters.

The vertical test is as follows:  Let avg=(x3+x4)/2.  Then x0 is in error
if:
                 x0 &lt C     or   D < x0
where
       C = min(avg-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#cltol">CLTOL</A>, x3-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dcltol">DCLTOL</A>, x4-DCLTOL)
       D = max(avg+<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#cutol">CUTOL</A>, x3+<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dcutol">DCUTOL</A>, x4+DCUTOL)
The thresholds <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#cltol">CLTOL</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#cutol">CUTOL</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dcltol">DCLTOL</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dcutol">DCUTOL</A> are specifiable parameters.

ADESPIKE processes the pixels in the same order as they are stored in the
input file.  I.e., the image lines are processed in ascending order, and
the pixels for a given line are processed in ascending sample order.  Note
that when a pixel is corrected, the corrected value is used when testing
and replacing adjacent pixels (to the immediate right and below).

The pixel replacement value may be modified via the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dn">DN</A> parameters.
Specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A>=n (where n is a positive integer) specifies that only the
n most-significant-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">bits</A> of error-pixels are to be replaced.  For example,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A>=3 specifies that the 3 most-significant-bits of x0 are to
be replaced, while the 5 least-significant-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">bits</A> (assuming byte data)
remain unchanged.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A>=0 is specified, then the appropriate number
of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">bits</A> to replace is automatically determined from the specified
thresholds.  The default (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#bits">BITS</A>=-1) is to replace all bits.

Specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/adespike_level2.html#dn">DN</A>=m causes all error-pixels to be replaced by m.

BINARY LABEL SUPPORT

If the input image contains binary labels (Ref. 1), then ADESPIKE will copy
the binary labels to the output file and add information regarding all spikes
that it has identified and removed. If the binary labels contain information
regarding data drop-outs, ADESPIKE will use this information to avoid using
data drop-outs in the detection and interpolation process.

TIMING:

The following times were measured for an 800x800 byte image:
    5.8 CPU sec on 8650
    32.5 CPU sec on 780
