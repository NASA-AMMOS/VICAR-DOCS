     Two inputs are required.  The first input is a VICAR labelled image of the 
CIBR.  It may be byte, halfword, or integer, but must not contain negative 
values or values greater than 32767.
     The second input is a table (ASCII file, not a VICAR labelled file) of two
columns.  The first column should contain the values of water content, while the
second column should have the corresponding CIBR values.  Entries that have CIBR
values outside the range 0 to 1, or water values less than or equal to 0, are
discarded.

The output dataset is an image of water content.  It has a data type of real,
regardless of the input data type.  The image will have the same units as the
water column in the input table.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#size">size</A> parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the computation is to take place.  It is specified
as  (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#sl">SL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#ss">SS</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#nl">NL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#ns">NS</A>), where
	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#sl">SL</A> is the starting line 
	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#ss">SS</A> is the starting sample
	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#nl">NL</A> is the number of lines to be procesed
	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/watermap_level2.html#ns">NS</A> is the number of samples (pixels) on each line
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
This value is multiplied to all pixels prior to applying the CIBR
transformation.  It must be specified to get the units of the CIBR image
to match the units used to determine the fit parameters.
