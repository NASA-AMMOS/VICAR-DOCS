<pre>
Converts PIC formatted images to VICAR.  PIC is a trivially simple file format
used by the Robotics Group at JPL.  It consists of a 4-byte header with lines
and samples followed by image data.

PIC does not seem to support multi-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/pic2vic_level2.html#band">band</A> data.  However, the FIDO rover at
least uses it that way.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/pic2vic_level2.html#band">BAND</A> parameter can be used to select a band to
read.  No check is made that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/pic2vic_level2.html#band">band</A> is present.  Data for each band simply
follows each other in the file with no intervening header.  There is also
no header to specify the number of bands (which is why it's not checked).
