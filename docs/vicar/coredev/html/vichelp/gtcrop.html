PURPOSE

     gtcrop cuts an image by a polygon, leaving the inside
     at the input image value and the outside all zero.  The
     polygon is stored in two columns of an IBIS table and
     is in (line,samp) coordinate of the image.  If you have
     geographic coordinates, use gtproj and/or pixmap to get
     the coordinates into image (line,samp).
     
     The user can choose whether the output is the same size
     as the input, or is reduced in size to barely contain 
     the polygon.  The latter case has two features:
     
     1.  A geotiff label is updated for the reduced image.
     2.  The starting (line,samp) of the reduced image in
         the original image can be output to TCL variables.

     where

     PIC                 is an image.
     INT                 is    an   IBIS   interface    file

     CUTPIC              is  a subimage of PIC with pixels outside 
                         of the polygon changed to zero.
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/gtcrop_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>                are the columns containing the polygon

     'COVERPOL           causes CUTPIC to have a reduced size, just
                         large enough to contain the intersection of
                         the poly with PIC
OPERATION
The pixel center is used to determine whether a pixel is
in or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/gtcrop_level2.html#out">out</A>.

"Inside" is determined in a primitive fashion by
determining the number of crossings (of the polygon)
by the infinite horizontal line containing the pixel.
The polygon is not checked for closedness, so a u-shaped
polygon will cut an image as well.  Closed polygons
(last point equals the first point) are recommended.
Difficult cases of polygon corners nearly exactly on
a line of pixels are handled by varying the polygon
by 1.e-8 of a pixel usually in the larger direction.

The polygon should be in the cyclic order (line,sample,
line,sample,...) in the columns specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/gtcrop_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>
parameter.
