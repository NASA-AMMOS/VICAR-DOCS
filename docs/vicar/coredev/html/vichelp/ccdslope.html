PURPOSE:
 
CCDSLOPE measures the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer properties of a CCD camera system.
The camera's response to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> is assumed to be linear, and the slope
and offset of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer curve are determined by the program.
 
The program is one of a series of programs originally developed to support
radiometric calibration of the Galileo SSI camera system.

EXECUTION:
 
         CCDSLOPE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=LTF.DAT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=MARK.DAT user-parameters...
 
The input is a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">Light</A> Transfer File (LTF) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer
sequence.  The LTF must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and
loaded with data via MOMGEN.
 
The output is an optional MARK-format tiepoint data set containing the
centers of all rejected areas.
 
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:
 
For a linear camera system, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer curve has the following
form:
                d = m*e + b
 
where
        d = output signal (DN)
        e = incident <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> energy (foot-lambert-milliseconds (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=LUMINANC) or
                    picoamp-milliseconds (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=RADIANCE))
 
and m and b are the slope and offset terms to be determined.
The incident <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> energy is computed from
 
                e = L*t
 
where
        L = <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> canon setting (foot-lamberts (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=LUMINANC) or
                                 picoamp (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=RADIANCE))
        t = exposure time (milliseconds)
 
CCDSLOPE performs a least squares fit to solve for m and b, given data
points d  acquired at exposure times t .
        i                             i
 
OPERATION:

CCDSLOPE performs the following steps:
 
  1) Read data from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">Light</A> Transfer File.
  2) Compute slope and offset for each area.
  3) Compute mean value for slope and offset and flag all areas
     deviating by more than 2 sigma from the mean.
  4) Re-compute the mean value for slope and offset, ignoring all
     flagged values as specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A> parameter.
 
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer curve slope and offset for a given area is determined
by computing the mean DN and energy at each exposure time, and fitting
the resulting data points (d ,t ) via least squares.
                            i  i
 
The dark current frame (EXPO=0.0) is normally included as a data point
on the curve.  For GLL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> transfer sequences which contain extended
exposure mode frames, an adjustment is required to correct for differences
between the normal and extended exposure dark current.  This correction
consists of subtracting the extended exposure dark current and adding
the normal dark current to the mean DN's of all extended exposure frames.
 
If the keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#subdc">SUBDC</A> is specified, the dark current is subtracted from the
mean DN at each exposure.  If extended exposure frames exist, then the
extended exposure dark current is subtracted the the mean DN's at these
exposures.
 
If extended exposure mode frames exist (possible for Galileo data), the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#extexpo">EXTEXPO</A> parameter must normally be specified to indicate the exposure
level at which the extended exposures begin.
 
   Example:  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#extexpo">EXTEXPO</A>=7 specifies that the 7th exposure level (above the
             dark current) begins the extended exposures.
 
However, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A>-transfer sequences consisting entirely of extend-exposure
frames should be input as if they were normal exposures, i.e. the extended-
exposure dark-current should be inserted in place of the normal dark-current
and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#extexpo">EXTEXPO</A> parameter should not be used.
 
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#offsets">OFFSETS</A> parameter is used to specify a shutter-offset file (as generated
by program CCDRECIP) containing the shutter-offset for each line or sample
of the image (800 values for GLL or 1024 for Cassini).  These shutter-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#offsets">offsets</A>
are used to correct for differences between the actual and commanded
exposures.  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#offsets">OFFSETS</A> parameter is not specified, then a mean shutter
offset is used (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#mofset">MOFSET</A> parameter).
 
Note:  The shutter-offset file supplied must contain one and only one
entry for each line or sample of the image data.  The 800 entries in
Galileo's line-dependent shutter-offset file correspond to the 800 lines
of a Galileo image.  The 1024 entries in the Cassini sample-dependent
shutter-offset file correspond to the 1024 samples of a Cassini image.
 
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#mofset">MOFSET</A> parameter may be used to specify a mean shutter-offset.  If
line- or sample-dependent shutter-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#offsets">offsets</A> are input via the OFFSETS
parameter, then the mean shutter-offset is computed by averaging these
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#offsets">offsets</A> (overriding the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#mofset">MOFSET</A> parameter).
 
If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A> parameter is specified (default=1), areas may be rejected
because of a bad value for the slope (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A>=1), offset (REJECT=2),
or either (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A>=3).  If REJECT=0, no area rejection is performed.
 
If the keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#deltax">DELTAX</A> is specified, the above steps are repeated
after adjusting the energy levels so that the resulting curve
passes through the origin.  This is accomplished by adding the
ratio OFFSET/SLOPE to each energy term.
 
CCDSLOPE prints <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#out">out</A> the following:
 
  1) Slope and offset for each area specified.
  2) Summary of all areas flagged for bad slope or offset.
  3) A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#table">table</A> listing mean DN vs input <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> energy for 6 regions.
  4) A global value for the slope and offset, computed by combining
     the data for all the good areas (and performing a fit.
 
If an output file is specified, then the centers of all flagged values
as specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#reject">REJECT</A> parameter are stored in a MARK format data
set.
 
If a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> file is specified, a plot of mean DN vs input <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">light</A> energy
is output to the file.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> is generated for the four corners and
center of the frame, and for the entire frame.
 
The illumination value specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">LIGHT</A> parameter is used to convert the
exposure times (msec) into incident energy (Foot-Lambert-msec (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=LUMINANC)
or picoamp (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#units">UNITS</A>=RADIANCE)).  The illumination value of for this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#light">Light</A> 
Transfer File may be defaulted such that it is read from the label of the 
file (for Cassini).  Parameter input will always override the value in the 
label.
 
If an output file is specified for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> parameter, an ASCII file of
tab-delimitted text is output.  This file will contain a tabular list of the
data contained in the plots.  For each of 6 areas (Upper left, Upper right,
Lower left, Lower right, Center and Whole frame), the following values are
tabulated for all exposure levels present in the LT file:
 
 Mean DN, DN computed from derived Slope and Offset, Energy
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A> parameters.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> allows the user to display data from 5 areas on the CCD on an x,y
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> using the gnuplot package after exiting the program. PLOT produces
a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi file extension.
Another file with an .asc extension is create containing columns of data
that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A> parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A>=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.

  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A> parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">PLOT</A>=outplot
  then for the interactive <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.      

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A>=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A>  'indata.dat.asc' u  1: 9 t .......


USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#out">out</A> as a separate file. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A>. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi

  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A>).

  Note: This program creates 5 output plots per run. You bring up each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A>
  panel sequentially. You close each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A>.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ccdslope_level2.html#plot">plot</A> library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.
