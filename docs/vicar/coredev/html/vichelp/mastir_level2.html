<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
The first file should contain the 9 channels of MAS TIR image data,
calibrated as radiance at sensor, in units of Watts per square meter per
steradian per micrometer.

The second file should be the MAS TIR calibration file (in VICAR format)
that is in effect for the date of data acquisition.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
The output dataset will contain upwelling radiance at surface data for the
ten MASTER TIR channels (Channels 42 to 50), in units of milliWatts per
sqare meter per steradian per micrometer.  Output pixels are halfword
(16 bit signed integer).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="size"><H3>SIZE</H3></A><pre>
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,716)
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sl"><H3>SL</H3></A><pre>
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
This parameter is ignored. The full width of the input (716 samples) is
always processed.  SS is forced to be 1.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
This parameter is ignored. The full width of the input (716 samples) is
always processed.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modinp"><H3>MODINP</H3></A><pre>
   The atmospheric and geometric parameters needed by this program to run
   MODTRAN are supplied by the user providing a valid MODTRAN input (TAPE5)
   file.  This file may be generated by the stand alone program "modin",
   or by any other means convenient to the user.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modout"><H3>MODOUT</H3></A><pre>
   As a default, the report file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODOUT, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset. If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   report file is saved under that name.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modtab"><H3>MODTAB</H3></A><pre>
   As a default, the tabular file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODTAB, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset. If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   tabular file is saved under that name.
