<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
      The file containing an instrument radiance iamge in watts, (for TIMS it 
      is six bands of a calibrated image, using the IRAD mode and WATTS units).

<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
      Output data set in 16-bit integer format of all the bands of ground 
      calibrated data.  The exact type of data output (e.g. temperature, 
      radiance, etc) is determined by the MODE parameter.

<A NAME="outp"><H3>OUTP</H3></A><pre>
      Output file produced by lowtran, if the default value of DUMMY is used,
      no output file will be produced. Also, even if Lowtran is run more than
      once by TCAL2, only the last run of Lowtran will have this output file.

<hr>
<A NAME="table"><H3>TABLE</H3></A><pre>
      Output file produced by lowtran containing a table of radiance and
      transmittance versus wavelength, if the default value of DUMMY is used,
      no output file will be produced. Also, even if Lowtran is run more than
      once by TCAL2, only the last run of Lowtran will have this output file.

<A NAME="demfile"><H3>DEMFILE</H3></A><pre>
      Optional input DEM file, which needs to have the same nl and same ns as
      the input file, also this file should be 16-bit integer and should be
      meters above MSL. TCAL2 finds the minimum and maximum elevation from
      this file, then runs Lowtran in that range at an interval specified by
      ELEVSTEP. (Lowtran is run twice at each calculated elevation; once at
      the maximum deflection of the field of view from nadir and once at the
      minimum deflection. For samples between these two deflections,
      interpolated values are calculated). When the output temperature or
      radiance is being calculated, the elevation of each pixel is looked up
      in the DEM and returned values from the run of Lowtran closest in
      elevation are used.  No interpolation is currently done between
      the values Lowtran returns for different elevations.

<hr>
<A NAME="filfile"><H3>FILFILE</H3></A><pre>
      Input filter function file for non-TIMS data. It should be in the
      following format:

filtertitle  =  test filter for TCAL2

startfilter
number of bands  =  3

band 1
8.000   0.0264
8.032   0.0268
8.064   0.0275

band 2
8.480   0.0394
8.512   0.0503

band 3
8.800   0.0288
8.832   0.9294
8.864   0.0298

      The string following "filtertitle  = " is put in a vicar label called
      FILTER on the output file.
      The strings "startfilter" and "number of bands  =  3" are required to tell
      the program where to start reading the filter data, these two strings
      should be on separate lines. There can be anything in the file before
      the "startfilter" line, but after it you may confuse the program if
      there are any extra lines starting with the word "band" or if the are
      extra lines staring with numbers. 
      "band 1", "band 2" and "band 3" tell the program where data for each band
      begins. The first column of data is the wavelength in microns and the
      second column is the response.

      Tcal2 finds the minimum and maximum wavelength from all the filters it
      reads, and runs Lowtran with the corresponding range of wavenumbers.
      (Lowtran parameters V1 and V2, right now the Lowtran parameter DV is
      hardcoded to be 5 cm-1). If you have a series of filters covering a wide
      wavelength range, Lowtran will take longer to run than if you cover a
      narrow range.  Specifying FILTLIST keyword will make the program print
      to the screen the filter values it has read in from the file and the
      filters it has interpolated from these to match Lowtran's output.  The
      filters for each band in the filter file do not have to have the same
      wavelength spacing, a different spline is calculated for each band.

<hr>
<A NAME="calmode"><H3>CALMODE</H3></A><pre>
      This keyword selects the type of decalibration to be performed.
      There is a choice of three possibilities:
            GRAD - (Ground RADiance)
                   Radiance values of the ground target in the
                   scene, incorporating atmospheric corrections.
            GTEM - (Ground TEMperature)
                   Kinetic temperature of the ground target, assuming the
                   emissivity values given by the parameter "E"
            BTEM - (Brightness TEMperature)
                   Brightness temperature of the ground target.
            EMIS - (EMISsivity)
                   The emissivity of the ground, calculated with
                   respect to the REFCHAN given (with atmospheric
                   corrections).
      Example: MODE  =  GRAD
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="amodel"><H3>AMODEL</H3></A><pre>
	This selects the model atmosphere for which the atmospheric cor-
	rections will be computed.  The program uses a version of LOWTRAN
	as a subroutine, to which AMODEL is passed.  The exact parameters
	of each model is given in the LOWTRAN handbook.  The options in
	brief:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
                RS - User supplied (e.g. Radiosonde) model atmosphere
	These same abbreviations are used with the HUMID parameter, with
	the same meanings.
		Example: LMODEL  =  SW
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="models"><H3>MODELS</H3></A><pre>
	The MODELs parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, or to 
    	specify default atmospheres to use with a RS AMODEL.  The choices
        are the same as those given in the AMODEL description and with the same
	meanings. The seven elements of MODELS specify Lowtran Parameters
        M1-M^ and MDEF respectively.
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: MODELS  =  (SW,SW,SW,MW,MW,MW,ST)
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="factors"><H3>FACTORS</H3></A><pre>
        Used to specify the lowtram parameters H2OFAC, CO2FAC, O3FAC, O2FAC,
         CH4FAC and  SO2FAC
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="height"><H3>HEIGHT</H3></A><pre>
	Variable HEIGHT gives the altitude above mean sea level of the
	TIMS aircraft as it scanned the particular flight line.  The
	units of HEIGHT are kilometers.  A default value of 10 kilometers
	is used as a nominal approximation of a typical TIMS overflight.
		Example: HEIGHT  =  12.5
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="datum"><H3>DATUM</H3></A><pre>
	The DATUM is the mean elevation in kilometers of the target
		above mean sea level.  A default value of 1 meter is
	used if the user does not specify the DATUM explicitly.  Again,
	this variable is used only in the MODE  =  GRAD, GTEM or EMIS cases.
		Example: DATUM  =  0.2

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="gndalt"><H3>GNDALT</H3></A><pre>

       GNDALT is used to specify the ground elevation beneath the
       target, if no value is specified, TCAL2 calculates it to be
       0.0001 km below DATUM or the values it gets from the DEM.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tbound"><H3>TBOUND</H3></A><pre>

      The temperature of the ground, Lowtrans defaults it to the temperature
      of the lowest atmospheric level if nothing is specified

 
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="elevstep"><H3>ELEVSTEP</H3></A><pre>
        Elevation step between successive runs of Lowtran when using a DEM.
        TCAL2 finds the minimum and maximum elevation from the DEM then runs
        Lowtran twice at each elevation(i) &lt max elevation, where

          elevation(i)  =  min elevation + i x elevstep.

        So Lowtran must be run

          2 x  (max elevation - min elevation) / elevstep

        times. If elevstep is small enough and the input image is large
        enough, TCAL2 may fail because of memory limitations. TCAL2 needs
        to run at least

          5 x ((max elev - min elev) / elevstep) x bands x samples x 4

        bytes.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tilt"><H3>TILT</H3></A><pre>
        Pointing of the instrument's center of field of view off
        nadir (+ direction is towards the zero sample).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="defl"><H3>DEFL</H3></A><pre>
       Half the field of view of the instrument, the default: 38.28 is for TIMS

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="e"><H3>E</H3></A><pre>
        This is the emissivity assumed for each band, when computing the
        sky radiance reflected by the ground. In the GTEM mode, these values
        are also used to compute the ground kinetic temperature.  In the
        EMIS mode, the REFCHAN band value is used to set that band's 
        emissivity.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="refchan"><H3>REFCHAN</H3></A><pre>
	The band to which the other bands are to be referenced, in
	the case of Emissivity data, is input through this parameter.
	The default is band six is used.
		Example: REFCHAN  =  5
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="date"><H3>DATE</H3></A><pre>
	TCAL2 uses the date of data acquisition to determine the proper
	calibration coefficients.  If defaulted, the date in the VICAR 
	label is used. This parameter is needed if the VICAR label
	is incorrect, or if an abnormal calibration set is to be used.
        Date is also needed if IEMSCT = 2; in that case TCAL2 calculates DOY
        from it for the Lowtran7 parameter IDAY.
