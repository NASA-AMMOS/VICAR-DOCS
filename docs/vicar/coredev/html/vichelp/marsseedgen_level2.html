<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Two files containing the input stereo pair images.  The pixel data from these
files are not used; only the label information is used to determine the
pointing and camera models.

A single file list file may also be specified (a la marsmos, etc.), but the
file list must have only two entries.

Note that there's no actual requirement that the first input be left or the
second right.  The two images can be given in any order.  The first image,
though, is the "master" image; the disparity maps and output files match the
first image's pixels.  Convention places left first, however.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output file containing the tiepoints (seed points).  The format is the same
as the output of marstie (and the in_tpt input for marsnav).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving different (and presumably better) output coordinates.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nseeds"><H3>NSEEDS</H3></A><pre>
Maximum number of seeds to write to the output.  Actual number may be less
if the seed points don't project into the second image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the
stereo cameras. The two options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY which means no surface
is used or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface =PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters.  For the cases when PLANE
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">surface</A>,
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same.

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsseedgen.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsseedgen.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsseedgen_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
