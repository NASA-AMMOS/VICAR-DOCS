<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
There are two options for describing input images. 

Either:
List the image file names 

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="in_mesh"><H3>IN_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Input mesh file in OBJ format. The OBJ file is expected to contain vertices
coordinates, faces (only triangular faces).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out_mesh"><H3>OUT_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Output file name of the refined mesh. Should be an OBJ type of file. The number 
vertices and faces may be different than the output if some of the vertices are
deemed invalid per user parameters (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#min_vertices">MIN_VERTICES</A>, MIN/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#max_dist">MAX_DIST</A>).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="refimages"><H3>REFIMAGES</H3></A><pre>
List of indexes (1-based) in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#inp">INP</A> list identifying the reference images. Default
is 1, i.e.,  the first image of the list. There could be several reference 
images, in which case, in turn, they will all be reference image with respect to
the rest of the list (non-reference images and other reference images). For
instance if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A> is 1,2,3, then all images of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#inp">INP</A> will be projected to the
mesh, then backprojected onto img 1 and correlated. The correlation score of
all pixels will be cumulated. Then all images will be projected on the mesh, 
then backprojected onto img2 and correlated, augmenting the global correlation
score. And so on with img 3. 
Potentially all images in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#inp">INP</A> could be references images. Beware though, it can
lead to very long processing time.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A> can be a single image, or a list of images.  Each image in the
list will be a reference image.  (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#until">UNTIL</A>).  This allows any arbitrary
images to be selected as references.  If an image number is negative, it means
all images from the previous number through (the absolute value of) this one 
will be references.  For example a list:

1,3,-6,8,11,-15

will cause the following images to be reference imgaes:

1,3,4,5,6,8,11,12,13,14,15

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A>=-1 defaults to first image is a reference image.
Numbering of images starts at 1.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="texture_ids"><H3>TEXTURE_IDS</H3></A><pre>
List of images indices (w.r.t. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#inp">INP</A> list) that will be used to texture the mesh.
The order of the indices sets the priority of the images in texturing the mesh.
The first image is used to texture as many faces as possible. Then, if some 
faces are not textured by the first image (because of occlusion for instance), 
the second image is used to texture the faces that haven't yet been textured.
And so on. If the mesh is the output of a single stereo-correlation, it is 
highly recommended to use first the master image of that stereo-pair. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="evaluate"><H3>EVALUATE</H3></A><pre>
If set, the process is run <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#until">until</A> the optimization starts and print out some
information about the setup. Most notably, the global correlation score and
the global curvature cost will be printed. The values can be used to decide
on the regularization weight to apply (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A>). Once LAMBDA value has been
decided, the program can be re-run with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A> set to the proper value and
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#evaluate">EVALUATE</A> removed.

These two costs, which represent
the data attachement and regularization costs are added like this:
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">lambda</A> is a weigthing factor (see LAMBDA)


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="min_vertices"><H3>MIN_VERTICES</H3></A><pre>
This indicates the minimum size of a mesh patch (in number of vertices) for it
to be refined. The refinement involves a series of mathematical operations on
the mesh requires vertices on the edge and vertices whose neighbor vertices is 
on the mesh edge to be held static (no refinement). So too small mesh patches
are not worth being refined as most of the vertices will be held fixed. This
parameters sets the minimum size of the mesh patch to consider for refinement.
Default is 20.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="min_dist"><H3>MIN_DIST</H3></A><pre>
Minimum distance (in the unit of the mesh file - usually meters) between the 
mesh vertices and the reference image cameras positions. All vertices that are 
closer to any reference image camera will be removed from the refinement.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_dist"><H3>MAX_DIST</H3></A><pre>
Same thing as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#min_dist">MIN_DIST</A> but for a maximum distance.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="lambda"><H3>LAMBDA</H3></A><pre>
The global cost which is minimized is the sum of the two components:
- The data attachement term, which is the sum of the (inverse) of the 
correlation scores. The better the correlation, the smaller the score.
- The regularization term, which is a measurment of the global curvature of the
mesh.
Essentially we have:
global cost = data cost + <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">lambda</A> * regularization cost.
The balancing between the two terms is controlled via a weigting factor, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A>.
The higher <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">lambda</A>, the smoother will be the mesh.
Estimating a good <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#lambda">LAMBDA</A> is not trivial and usually involves a trial and error
approach.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sigma"><H3>SIGMA</H3></A><pre>
The correlation is done through a gaussian window (as opposed to a square 
window). <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#sigma">SIGMA</A> scales the width of the gaussian spread (standard
deviation). The default is 2 pixels.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nb_sigma"><H3>NB_SIGMA</H3></A><pre>
How large of a correlation window do we want, in terms of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#sigma">sigma</A>. For instance
if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#sigma">SIGMA</A> is set to 2 and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#nb_sigma">NB_SIGMA</A> is set to 3 (the default), then a gaussian
window of about 6x6 pixels will be used.



<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
The optional input navigation table.  If provided, this allows the user to
provide an initial nav solution, which is then tweaked by the marsnav process.
This allows a pointing solution created by other means, (such as MICA) or via
an earlier marsnav run, to be adjusted.  This may be used to better globally
distribute error or accomodate new tiepoints, among other things.

Note that there is no guarantee the result will bear any resemblance to the
input nav file.  It is merely a starting point, and marsnav may go off in a
completely different direction.


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out_solution_id"><H3>OUT_SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Solution id for the OUTPUT navigation file in XML format.
If solution id is missing when FORMAT=XML, then the output
navigation file can not be created (therefore the parameter is required).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for the INPUT nav file (if present).

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system. These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Normally
it is not used.



<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="until"><H3>UNTIL</H3></A><pre>
Means that all images from 1 to the first value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A> inclusive are
treated as reference images. Any additional images listed in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A> will also
be reference images.

The functionality of this parameter has been subsumed by the negative number
feature of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A>.  For example, REF=5 -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#until">UNTIL</A> is the same as REF=\(1,-5\).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ignore"><H3>IGNORE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a list of images that won't be reference images. This parameter may 
be used when all but a few images are to be reference. It is easier then to 
set up all images as references (with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A>) and identify with this 
parameters which ones are not. 

Like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#ignore">IGNORE</A> accepts negative numbers to indicate ranges.  So a value
of 4,-7 means 4,5,6,7 are all ignored.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#refimages">REFIMAGES</A> for more examples.


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing using OMP, which uses multiple cores on
a single host machine.  The default is on.  The main help describes some
environment variables that can further control parallel processing.  Note
that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built in to the gcc/g+ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP documentation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for reading the nav file.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

Applies only to an input nav file, if given (not to the output nav file).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsnav, except for one place.  It is
here for compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see
e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsnav (except in one case; see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>).  It
is here for compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see
e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#until">until</A> the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrefmesh_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.
