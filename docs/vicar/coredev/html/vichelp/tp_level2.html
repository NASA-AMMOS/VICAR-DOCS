Various command-line options can be given to the program.  Typical options
might be a -display to redirect the display somewhere, or a -xrm to set a
resource.  See the on-line help for details.

One trouble spot with TAE is when you need to quote strings.  For example,
a -xrm specification has to be of the form:  -xrm "resource: value"  where the
double quotes are actually present in the string submitted to DCL or the
shell.  Specifying such resources is unfortunately platform-dependent.
Unix will accept single quotes (usually), while VMS requires double quotes.
You can double the quotes for VMS, however, this doesn't work on Unix.
For example:

Unix:
	tp /usr/local/images/io.red opt="-xrm '*background: grey'"

VMS:
	tp images:io.red opt="-xrm ""*background: grey"""
