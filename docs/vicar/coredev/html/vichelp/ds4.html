PURPOSE:
DS4 attempts to remove 6 line striping from LANDSAT imagery by
performing localized histogram matching of the 6 sensors.

EXECUTION:

Examples
	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A>

	will remove striping using sensor 3 as the reference sensor
	(which is the default), and assuming 3 sets per <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> (default).
	The first line of the first set, in this case, is line number 1,
	chosen so that the reference sensor becomes the third line within
	the set.

	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A>=5

	will remove striping as above, with the exception that the
	reference sensor will be sensor number 5, making line number 3
	the first line of the first set.

	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A> '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A>

	will remove striping as in the first example above, but instead
	of using one particular sensor as a reference sensor, will
	use the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">average</A> of all of the sensors as a reference.  Line 1
	is again the first line in the first set.

	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A> '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A>=6

	Here the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A> option has been combined with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A> option
	to cause averaging and, at the same time, make sensor number 6
	the third line in the image.  The net effect is to ignore the
	first three lines of the first set.  Again, as above, the
	number of lines per <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> defaults to 3.

	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A>=(1,2,3,2,1) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A>=1

	The reference sensor is sensor number 1, and there are three sets
	in a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A>.  Line 5, then, is the first line of the first set.
	The reference CDF is filtered with the weights 1,2,3,2,1 before
	matching is performed.

	DS4 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">OUT</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A>=2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">GROUP</A>=7 '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A>  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A>=(1,2,1)

	Averaging and filtering are performed as above, and line number 6
	is the first line of the first set.  Note, here, that there are
	7 sets per <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A>.

SPECIAL NOTES:
1) LANDSAT frames have been received with 12 line striping superimposed
   upon the 6 line striping.  DS4 will not correct the 12 line striping.
   The 12 line striping should be removed by other means prior to the
   execution of DS4.
2) DS4 is unable to remove 6 line striping from water bodies.


OPERATION:
The input picture is considered to be subdivided into contiguous sets of
6 lines each.  The starting line of a given set is determined by the
reference sensor number such that the reference sensor becomes the third
line within the set.  For example, if the reference sensor were chosen to
be 5, then the starting line of the first set would be 3 and that of the
second set would be 9, and so on.  Note that the line numbers above
refer to the image given by the VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#size">size</A> field.  That is, if a subarea
is specified, then line 5 above refers to the fifth line of the subarea.

To initiate the matching process, the CDF's for each sensor are compiled
using the first <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> of sets (i.e., the first GROUP sets).  The reference
CDF is that of the specified sensor <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A>.  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A> parameter is
specified, the reference CDF is taken to be the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">average</A> of all 6 sensor
CDF's.  If the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A> is specified, then the reference CDF
is low-pass filtered using the integer weights F1, . . ., FN.  The CDF
of each sensor is matched to that of the reference CDF and corresponding
transfer tables are generated.  The first ((N2-1)/2) + 1 sets plus any
lines skipped over at the beginning (see the first paragraph) are then
transformed using the generated transfer table.

Subsequent sets are transformed in the following manner:
1) The CDF's of the sensors of the first set in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> are subtracted
   <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#out">out</A> of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> sensor CDF's.
2) The CDF's of the sensors in the first set following the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> are added
   in to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> sensor CDF's.
3) The transfer tables are generated as before.
4) The middle set of the updated <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A> is transformed.

This process continues until the last set of the image has been included
in a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#group">group</A>.  At this point, the middle set of the group, all sets following
it, and any lines after the last set are transformed.

The parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A> are not mutually exclusive.  While the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">AVERAGE</A> parameter will override the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A> parameter in terms of how the
reference CDF is generated (i.e., from one sensor or from an <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#average">average</A> of all
six sensors), the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/ds4_level2.html#rsen">RSEN</A> parameter can be used to define which lines
compose the first set of lines and hence all subsequent sets of lines.
This was illustrated in the examples.
