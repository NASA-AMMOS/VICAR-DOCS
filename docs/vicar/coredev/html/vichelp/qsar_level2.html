<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/qsar.html">QSAR</A></H1>
<A NAME="area"><H3>AREA</H3></A>
<pre>
The values entered for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/qsar_level2.html#area">AREA</A> parameter are entered in groups of five.
Each group corresponds to a rectangle.  The meaning of the values in each
group is as follows.

  First value  - starting line number of the rectangle.
  Second value - starting pixel number of the rectangle. 
  Third value  - number of lines in the rectangle.
  Fourth value - number of pixels per line in the rectangle.  
  Fifth value  - the integer value to be added to the data numbers for points 
                 in the rectangle.  For byte data, this value should be in the
                 range -255 to 255.  For halfword data, this value should be 
                 in the range -65535 to 65535.

The maximum number of rectangles that can be specified for QSAR is limited
by the TAE executive.  As of this writing the limit is 60 rectangles.
If no rectangles are specified, QSAR copies the image without making any
changes.
