<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp.html">MARSDISPWARP</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input right image and (optional) left image.  Can be any format (except
complex).  Providing the left (second) image is highly recommended, to get
the camera models in the output label correct (see the main help).

The image data and the bulk of the label is taken from the first image.
It is the non-reference image (by convention, "right") used in the correlation
process.  So if the disparity map goes L-&gtR, the input files are (R, L).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output warped image.  Image will match the geometry of the reference ("left")
image given to the correlator.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="disp"><H3>DISP</H3></A><pre>
Input disparity image.  See the correlator programs for a description of
the format.  Must be a single 2-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#band">band</A> file.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#band">band</A> number to use, if a single band is desired.  The default
if not specified is to process all bands.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="disp_pyramid"><H3>DISP_PYRAMID</H3></A><pre>
Pyramid level of disparity.  Matches PYRAMID in marsjplstereo and
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> in marscor3.  0 means the disparity image is full size,
1 means half size, 2 means quarter size, etc.  See the main help, and
also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pixel_count"><H3>PIXEL_COUNT</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, the number of non-zero pixels will be writen <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#out">out</A> to
CORRELATION_PIXEL_COUNT in the DERIVED_IMAGE_PARMS label.  For multiband
images, the count is incremented if any of the bands are non-zero (so
100% coverage would be <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#nl">NL</A>*<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#ns">NS</A>, not NL*NS*NB).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="disp_zoom"><H3>DISP_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">Zoom</A> factor for disparity.  Combined with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> via multiplication,
thus final <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> is (2^<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A>)*<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A>).  Allows for disparity
zooms other than powers of 2.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zoom"><H3>ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">Zoom</A> factor for the output image.  Creates an image bigger or smaller than
what it "naturally" would be given the inputs.  See the main help.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="interp"><H3>INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off interpolation in the image.  Interpolation is on by default,
and should be used with normal images.  With the advent of nonzero <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#interp">interp</A>,
interpolation should normally be used, unless warping an image of discrete
values, such as a classification map or status flag <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#band">band</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="disp_interp"><H3>DISP_INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off interpolation in the disparity map.  Disparity interpolation
is on by default, and should normally be used.  It allows zooms and disparity
zooms to occur without blockiness, but can also be affected by noise in the
disparity map.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nonzero_interp"><H3>NONZERO_INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off nonzero interpolation of the pixels.  See the main help for
a description of this algorithm.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#interp">Interp</A> must also be on for this to have any
effect.  The default is on.  Nonzero <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#interp">interp</A> is always on for the input
disparity map (unless <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_interp">disp_interp</A> is entirely off).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ref_not_zoomed"><H3>REF_NOT_ZOOMED</H3></A><pre>
Specifies that the reference image has NOT been zoomed by the disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>.
Useful in certain situations involving chanining of warps through multiple
disparity maps.  See the main help.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sl"><H3>SL</H3></A><pre>
Starting line for output.  Specified relative to the "natural" size of the
output (as if this parameter were not given).  Defaults to 1 (no window).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
Starting sample for output.  Specified relative to the "natural" size of the
output (as if this parameter were not given).  Defaults to 1 (no window).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
Number of lines for output.  Specified relative to the "natural" size of the
output (as if this parameter were not given).  Defaults to full natural size.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>
Number of samples for output.  Specified relative to the "natural" size of the
output (as if this parameter were not given).  Defaults to full natural size.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

Also used for general but uncommonly used parameters in the PIG library.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.
