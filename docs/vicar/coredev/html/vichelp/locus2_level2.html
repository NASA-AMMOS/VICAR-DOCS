<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
String
1 or 2 input MARK-format coordinate files.  The first input holds the 
coordinates to be transformed.  The second input holds the reference
set (possibly generated by GRIDGEN).  The second input may have the 
keywords GRID_NROW and GRID_NCOL in the label to define the size
of the coordinates sets.  

The second input is optional.  If it is not supplied, LOCUS2 will
generate a perfect grid comparable to that generated by GRIDGEN.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nrow"><H3>NROW</H3></A><pre>
Integer
Number of rows in the coordinate grid.  
This is used to override
missing or invalid value of GRID_NROW in the second input label.  
It is also used to construct the perfect grid if no second input is
supplied.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ncol"><H3>NCOL</H3></A><pre>
Integer
Number of columns in the coordinate grid.  
This is only used to override
missing or invalid value of GRID_NCOL in the second input label.  
It is also used to construct the perfect grid if no second input is
supplied.

<hr>
<A NAME="srofiles"><H3>SROFILES</H3></A><pre>
String, count=3
The names of the three files to contain the output for the Scale, 
Rotation and Offset fit. The first file will get the tab-delimitted 
ASCII file containing the residual in the line direction after the 
SRO fit.  The second will get the tab-delimitted ASCII file containing 
the residual in the sample direction after the SRO fit.  The third 
will get the tab-delimitted ASCII file containing the magnitude of 
the residual after the SRO fit.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uncfiles"><H3>UNCFILES</H3></A><pre>
String, count=3
The names of the three files to contain the output for the Unconstrained
fit. The first file will get the tab-delimitted ASCII file containing 
the residual in the line direction after the Uncontrained fit.  The 
second will get the tab-delimitted ASCII file containing the residual 
in the sample direction after the Uncontrained fit.  The third will get 
the tab-delimitted ASCII file containing the magnitude of the residual 
after the Uncontrained fit.

<hr>
<A NAME="radial"><H3>RADIAL</H3></A><pre>
The name of the file to contain the table of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#radial">radial</A> distance vs. magnitudes 
and components.  The file is a tab-delimitted ASCII file containing one 
record for each coordinate point.  The record contains the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#radial">radial</A> distance 
from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#center">center</A> of the image, the magnitude, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#radial">radial</A> and azimuthal components
of the SRO residual, and the magnitude, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#radial">radial</A> and azimuthal components of the
Unconstrained residual. 
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="center"><H3>CENTER</H3></A><pre>
The (line,samp) of the image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#center">center</A>.  Required if the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/locus2_level2.html#radial">RADIAL</A> is given.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uncres"><H3>UNCRES</H3></A><pre>
NAME - OPTIONAL - DEFAULT=DMY1
The name of the TCL variable to receive the value of the residuals for the
unconstrained fit.
