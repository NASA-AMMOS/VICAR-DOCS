<pre>
ALPHAR performs the alpha residual transformation on an input dataset.
The input dataset must be in units of Watts/meter^2/micrometer/steradian
in order for this program to work correctly. This differs from the input 
dataset requirements of this program prior to November, 2004

The output has one more band than the input. This extra band contains
the wavelength weighted log mean of the input radiance. This can be 
thought of as a pseudo temperature image. It does show emissivity 
effects but these are subdued compared to those in the original imagery.

For more information about this algorithm see Kealy and Hook (1993). 
"Separating temperature and emissivity in thermal infrared 
multispectral scanner data: Implications for recovering 
land surface temperature." IEEE Transactions of Geoscience 
and Remote Sensing, vol. 31 pp.1155-1164.

Testing
This program was tested on an artificial 2x2x6 band radiance dataset. 
It was also tested on an TIMS image acquired over Death Valley 
that was calibrated (TIMSCAL) and atmospherically corrected (TIMSCAL2)
to radiance at the surface.

RESTRICTIONS;
1. Input data must be in units of Watts/meter^2/micrometer/steradian
2. Maximum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/alphar_level2.html#size">size</A> of one band of the input is 10,000 values.
3. Maximum number of bands in the input is 20.
