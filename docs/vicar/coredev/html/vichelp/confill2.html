      CONFILL2 is a VICAR procedure that fills by interpolation an image of
 contour lines.  The input image must consist of contour lines, each of whose
 DN is equal to the value of the contour.  BYTE, HALF, FULL, and REAL data
 formats are all accepted as input.  The background pixels must all have a
 single DN value, given by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/confill2_level2.html#backgrnd">BACKGRND</A> parameter.  Interpolation is performed 
 in the horizontal and vertical directions in separate steps, and the final 
 result at each pixel is a linear interpolation of the horizontal and vertical 
 values.
      The user may choose either a linear or cubic spline interpolation for the
 horizontal and vertical interpolations, but the final combination is always by
 linear interpolation.  The values of the outermost contours are extended to 
 the edges of the image.
      This procedure uses four intermediate datasets, each the size of the
 input image.  The user is advised to override the default intermediate 
 dataset names with ones specifying scratch disks if space is likely to be
 a problem in the default directory.  The user is also warned that these
 intermediate datasets are all deleted upon completion of CONFILL2.
