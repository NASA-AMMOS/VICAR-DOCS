<H1>Help for AMER</H1>
<pre>
AMER performs the Average MMD Emissivity Residuals transformation on an 
input dataset. MMD is the Min-Max Difference. 
The input dataset must be in units of radiance as output by TIMSCAL2 
in order for this program to work correctly. These are mW/m*m/um/sr.

The output has one more band than the input. This extra band contains
the alpha temperature, the other bands contain the alpha emissivity.

The empirical calibration curve used to obtain the amer mean is
-0.790683 * mmd^0.723098
where MMD is the min-max difference of the alpha residual an ^ raises
to the power

Testing
This program was tested on an artificial 2x2x6 band radiance dataset. 

RESTRICTIONS;
1. Input data must be in halfword. This is a simple check since its
unlikely the input is not in radiance units if its in byte.
2. Maximum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/amer_level2.html#size">size</A> of one band of the input is 10,000 values.
3. Maximum number of bands in the input is 20.
