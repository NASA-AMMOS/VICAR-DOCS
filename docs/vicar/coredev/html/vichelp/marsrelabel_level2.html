<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out_cm"><H3>OUT_CM</H3></A><pre>
Optional filename for the output camera model.  It will be written in a
format compatible with Todd Litwin's library of CAHV camera model functions.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cm"><H3>CM</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cm">CM</A> is set, Camera_Model property group gets updated using calibration
camera models.  Based on label's info we point, scale, shift those calibration
models exactly the same way flight software is doing it.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pm"><H3>PM</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#pm">PM</A> is set, Pointing_Model gets updated/created in the label 
in the appropriate property group.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cs"><H3>CS</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cs">CS</A> is set, coordinate system property labels gets updated.  There weren't be
any changes, unless Rover State File is specified using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

Note that only the mobility-related coordinate systems will be rewritten.
This consists of Site, Local Level, and the equivalent of Rover frame for
the given mission.  Other frames, such as arm, arm tool, mast, camera, etc.
will not be updated, since there is no mechanism to change their value anyway.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="all"><H3>ALL</H3></A><pre>
Equivalent to setting to update <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cm">CM</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#pm">PM</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cs">CS</A>

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="change_cm_cs"><H3>CHANGE_CM_CS</H3></A><pre>
If set, causes the cmod to be expressed in the coordinate system specified in
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter, rather than the "natural" <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cs">CS</A> for the instrument. 
Does nothing if -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cm">CM</A> (or -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#all">ALL</A>) is not also specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="no_cm_xfer"><H3>NO_CM_XFER</H3></A><pre>
Normally, if -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cm">CM</A> is specified to update the camera model, the camera model
metadata (primarily MODEL_TRANSFORM_VECTOR and MODEL_TRANSFORM_QUATERNION)
are transferred over from the input model.  If this flag is specified,
this transfer is suppressed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_name"><H3>FIXED_NAME</H3></A><pre>
Overrides what <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cs">CS</A> type is allowed for the fixed frame.  Normally this is the
lowest-numbered SITE_FRAME.  However, the PIG library actually looks for any
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#cs">CS</A> with only one index as a potential fixed frame.  This causes issues with
the M20 helicopter, where e.g. the HELI_G_FRAME also has only one index.  This
parameter allows the user to force the fixed frame to SITE_FRAME.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/coredev/html/vichelp/marsrelabel_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....
