 "fft22" performs direct and inverse two dimensional fast fourier 
 transforms.  The program performs the same function, without the 
 array processor, as FFT2AP (which uses the array processor);  but
 "fft22" is more flexible in that the  image dimensions need not be
 powers of 2 (see RESTRICTIONS).  (Program FT2, with program FTPACK,
 does the same thing as FFT2AP with some restrictions and may be
 faster for large images.  See help for programs FFT2AP and FT2.) 
EXECUTION

"fft22" can be invoked by entering the command:

	fft22 IN <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#out">OUT</A> [<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>] PARAMS
where 

IN	is an input picture (forward <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#mode">mode</A>) or an FFT (transform mode)

OPERATION
 The program performs the following operation:

               M-1  N-1                   k*m   l*n
 O(k,l) =  K * SUM( SUM( I(m,n) exp( P * [--- + --- ]) )),
               m=0  n=0                    M     N

   for k = 0,1,...,M-1  and  l = 0,1,...,N-1,

 where:  I(m,n) is line m+1, sample n+1, of the input file,
         O(k,l) is line l+1, sample k+1, of the output file,
         K = 1 for a forward transform, and
             1/(M*N) for an inverse transform,
         P = 2*PI*i for a forward transform, and
             -2*PI*i for an inverse transform.
             [PI = 3.1416...,  i = SQRT(-1)]

 "fft22" uses subroutine DFFT to compute the one-dimensionsal fourier
 transform.  This is done twice, with a transposition step in between.
 For further computational details, see Help (in DCL) for that routine. 
 It uses an algorithm by Richard C. Singleton of Stanford Research
 Institute.
 
 As the above equation implies, the output of the program is stored
 in transposed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A>, in the matrix sense, compared to the input
 data.  This practice is responsible for faster program execution,
 because it allows one transposition to suffice (after the first
 1-D FFT), and does not bother with the second which would bring
 the output back into standard <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A>.  When a forward and inverse
 transform are performed in sequence, the two transpositions cancel
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#out">out</A> and the original <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A> is recovered.  However, the user must
 be aware of the transposition when working with the transformed data. 
 For example, when filtering by multiplication with a transfer
 function, the user must first transpose the transfer function (unless
 it is transpose-invariant).

 The transposition step requires a buffer of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#size">size</A> 2*N*N real*4 words,
 where N is the larger of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A>.  The default buffer <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#size">size</A> is 65536
 real*4 words, so the maximum image dimension that can be accomodated
 is 128. (32768 = 2*128*128); for a larger <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A>, the transposition
 cannot be performed in memory.  In this case, the operation is performed
 in several passes, with intermediate results being saved on disk.

 If disk storage of intermediate results is required, then the output
 file is used if it is of sufficient <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#size">size</A>, which is the case if the
 output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A> is complex (always true for forward <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#mode">mode</A>) and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A> is equal
 to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A>; otherwise, a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#scratch">scratch</A> file is used.  This file has a default value
 on a standard system <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#scratch">scratch</A> directory, but may be redefined using the
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#scratch">SCRATCH</A> parameter.
RESTRICTIONS:

1. For an inverse transform, the input <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A> must be complex.

2. Either dimension of the FFT (i.e., the number of lines or samples of
  the output in forward <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#mode">mode</A>) may be any number, subject to the following
  constraints:

  a. It may not contain a prime factor greater than 23.

  b. The number of prime factors may not exceed 208.

  c. The square-free portion may not exceed 210.  (A factor P of a number
    N is square-free if it cannot be paired with another identical factor
    of N; i.e., each prime occurring an odd number of times in N is a
    square-free factor of N.  The square-free portion of N is the product
    of its square-free factors.)

  E.g., 221 (=13*17) fails because the square-free part exceeds 210, and
  202 (=2*101) fails because a prime factor exceeds 23, but 210 (=2*3*5*7)
  and 216 (= 2**3 * 3**3) are acceptable.  These restrictions are due to
  subroutine DFFT and may be modified by changing array dimensions and
  recompiling that subroutine.

  The program checks if the dimensions of the input image meet these criteria
  and abends if they do not.  You can check these criteria for a given 
  number N by running this program on a test image with one line and N
  samples and seeing if the program abends.

3. The RMS file header does not support a record length exceeding 32767,
  hence a complex (8-byte per sample) image may not have <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A> equal to or
  above 4096.  Since "fft22" requires a square intermediate or output file 
  with a complex data <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A> whose dimension is the power 
  of 2 greater than or equal to the maximum of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A>
  and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A>, this implies that the largest value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A> or NS allowed is 2048.
  Thus, for the input file, neither <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#nl">NL</A> nor <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#ns">NS</A> may be greater than 2048.
  (Program FT2 can handle input images up to 4096 square because it uses
  a packed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#format">format</A>.)
TIMING

 The following CPU times were measured for "fft22" on a lightly loaded
 VAX-11/780:  (in seconds)

            image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#size">size</A>:      256x256     512x512    1024x1024

       Forward transform:       26         104         422

       Inverse transform:       28         114         451

 Processing time for a 1-dimensional FFT on N samples scales roughly as
 N * log(N).  However, the code of subroutine DFFT strongly favours values
 of N that contain few and low prime factors: powers of 2 are particularly
 efficient.

ORIGINAL PROGRAMMERS:  T. C. Rindfleisch and J. B. Seidman,  30 Oct. 1978

CONVERTED TO VAX BY:  J. H. Reimer and L. W. Kamp,  10 Feb. 1985

<A NAME="CogProg">CURRENT COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  L. W. Kamp</A>

HISTORY:

   1jul94 -- Made portable for UNIX  A. Scop (CRI)
  30aug90 -- changed COMPLEX to COMP in F.T. labels.

 Programming note:  the original matrix transposition algorithm was keyed
 to dimensions that were powers of 2.  When this requirement was relaxed
 by use of subroutine DFFT, the transposition algorithm was not changed.
 (The matrix is treated as if it were part of a larger square matrix whose
 dimension is a power of 2.)  Hence the buffer and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#scratch">scratch</A> file requirements
 can be quite wasteful, e.g., a 2*130 image requires the same <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/fft22_level2.html#scratch">scratch</A> file
 and buffer that a 256*256 image would, i.e. 0.5 MB.  If anyone would care
 to rewrite the program to eliminate this feature, they are invited to do so.
