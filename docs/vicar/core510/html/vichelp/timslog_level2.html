There are three options for this parameter:

EXABYTE (the default) should be used for the EXABYTE tapes that AMES sends
        <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/timslog_level2.html#out">out</A> without decommutation.  This is the current normal mode of
        operation.  These files have a logical record length of 32768 bytes.
AMES should be used for tapes that have been decommutated at the AMES
        facility. These files have a logical record length of 4188 bytes.
NSTL should be used for tapes (generally of ancient vintage) that have been
        decommutated at the NSTL (now Stennis) facility. Thes files have
        a record length of 1024 bytes, or less.
