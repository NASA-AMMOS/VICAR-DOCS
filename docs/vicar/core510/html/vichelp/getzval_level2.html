     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=(PIC,INT)       PIC is an image.
                         INT   is  an  IBIS  interface  file 
                         containing columns which give point 
                         locations in the image PIC.
                         No  output  file is  used  but  the 
                         second input file is modified.

     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>=(L,S,T,S) The   integers  L,S  specify  the   file 
                    columns   which  contain  the  line  and 
                    sample  coordinates  to  be  looked  up.  
                    Column T is used to store the  resultant 
                    grey  values.  Optional  column S stores
                    the sigma (0 means don't store sigma)

                    less than or equal to the parameter THR-

                    stored  instead of a  grey  value.   The 
                    marker  is  the value -999.0 .

     BILIN          specifies  bilinear  option.    When the 
                    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">WINDOW</A> is 2 then this is normal bilinear
                    interpolation  on the  surrounding  four
                    pixel values.   When  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">WINDOW</A> is  greater
                    than 2  then  the  edge  pixels  of  the 
                    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>  are  interpolated in  a bilinear
                    fashion  and the  inside  pixels of  the
                    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> are given full weight.    THIS IS
                    THE RECOMMENDED OPTION.
  
     NOIN           specifies no-interpolation option.   The 
                    DN-value  at the location nearest to the 
                    one  specified by line-sample  from  the 
                    columns L, S  will be read and stored in 
                    the column T.
  
     INTEGRAL       specifies no-interpolation option using
                    a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>.  The window size must be odd.
                    The pixel nearest to the line-sample
                    location is the center of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>.
                    The z-value will be the average of the
                    pixels in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>.
 
     SPOT           specifies no-interpolation option using
                    a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>.  The window size must be odd.
                    The  pixel  nearest  to the line-sample
                    location  is the  center of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A>.
                    The  z-value will be the average of the
                    pixels in  the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">window</A> that  fall within
                    a  circular  radius of the center.  The
                    radius is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#window">WINDOW</A>/2.
                          
     SPOT_R         same as SPOT except that the pixels are
                    weighted inversely with distance+1.  So
                    for the case  of line-sample at a pixel
                    the  center pixel  has weight  1.0, the
                    four  neighbors  weight  0.5,  the four 
                    diagonals  weight  0.414,  etc.    This 
                    algorithm  works  well  for  fractional
                    line-sample locations.
                    
                          
     SPOT_R2        same as  SPOT_R except that  the pixels
                    are weighted  inversely with distance+1
                    squared.

Use to vary the spot_r or spot_r2 formula.  The  formulas
use distance from the pixel center (which could be zero) so
a constant <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#spotfac">SPOTFAC</A> is added to guarantee non-zero.  If it is
small, a high emphasis is placed on a nearby point and other
points will have little effect.  Larger values will de-emphasize
the nearest point and will, in the limit, tend towards the
overall average of the pixels.  The default value of 2.0 is
suggested.

Data logged from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/getzval_level2.html#dted">DTED</A> disk might have this value problem.
You can tell by using the HIST program on the data set.  The 
input value is compared to -5000.  If larger, then the value is
not changed.  If smaller, then -(32768 plus the value) is used
in place of the value.  So -32767 is -1, -32766 is -2, etc.
