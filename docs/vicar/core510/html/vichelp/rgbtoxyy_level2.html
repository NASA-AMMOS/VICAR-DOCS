<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/rgbtoxyy.html">RGBTOXYY</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
INP = (input1,...,inputN), where the inputs are up to ten 
images decalibrated by the program GALSOS.  The images must have been taken
with different filters, must all be the same size, and registered.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
OUT = (x chromaticity, y chromaticity, Y tristimulus), optional_2d_histogram
Outputs 1-3 are always REAL format.
There is an optional fourth BYTE output file containing a 2-d histogram of
the chromaticity space. See help file for specifics.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="colors"><H3>COLORS</H3></A><pre>
COLORS = (1,...,10), where the colors are up to 10 special 
colors.  There must be at least as many colors named as there are input images.
Three valid colors have been defined for GLL, they have the names:
NAME     number       description                 comments
desert     1       Earth desert yellow  
water      2       Earth ocean blue     
cloud      3       Earth clouds         
Tables of XYZ tristimulus values and response in both radiance and
reflectance for these 3 colors are built into the program already.
If you specify the XYZ and RADIANCE values by parameter input then
you need not specify special colors.
Example: colors=(1,2,3)

<hr>
<A NAME="conv"><H3>CONV</H3></A><pre>
CONV=(factor1,...,factorN), where each conversion factor corresponds to an 
input image (as they are ordered in INP).  CONV allows all input images to be
scaled in the same units, and should be the same as those specified in the
program GALSOS.  Each factor is multiplied by each pixel in the corresponding 
input image.  The number of factors specified must be at most equal to the 
number of inputs specified.
The default is to use CONV values in the picture labels.
Only used in the 'RADIANCE mode.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="iovf"><H3>IOVF</H3></A><pre>
IOVF=(factor1,...,factorN), where each conversion factor corresponds to an 
input image (as they are ordered in INP).  IOVF allows all input images to be
scaled in the same units, and should be the same as those specified in the
program GALSOS.  Each factor is multiplied by each pixel in the corresponding 
input image.  The number of factors specified must be at most equal to the 
number of inputs specified.
The default is to use IOVF values in the picture labels.
Only used in the 'REFLECT mode.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter"><H3>FILTER</H3></A><pre>
The GLL filter position numbers (0 to 7) for each of the input images
in the order of input. Defaults to the filter position in the image
label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="xyz"><H3>XYZ</H3></A><pre>
Tristimulus values in the order X, Y, Z for each special color.
These offer a manual input. Usually they come from internal
tables pointed to by the COLORS keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="response"><H3>RESPONSE</H3></A><pre>
The radiance or reflectance values for each special color and for
each filter position input. In the order of each input for the
first special color followed by the order of input for the second
color...
These offer a manual input. Usually they come from internal
tables pointed to by the COLORS keyword and the FILTER keyword.
The I/F and CONV values are included in the RESPONSE so you must
provide either I/F*dn or CONV*dn.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies either reflectance or radiance units are to be used.
Specify either: 'RADIANCE or 'REFLECT (default is radiance).
Decalibrated images come with both I/F and CONV values so you must
tell the program which to use.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="print"><H3>PRINT</H3></A><pre>
print least squares fit coefficients and coefficient residuals.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="project"><H3>PROJECT</H3></A><pre>
Determines how to read the label to get information.

If you want to override project type in picture label and force the program 
to read that type of label then you can specify one of:
 GLL VGR-1 VGR-2 VIKOR MAR10 MAR-9 WFPC1 WFPC2

To not read any label specity : NONE

To let the program decide, specify: LABEL ( this is the default)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale"><H3>DNSCALE</H3></A><pre>
multiply the input dn's by dnscale. Used to rescale images compressed to byte 
format in order to restore the units to radiance or to reflectance.
 Defaults to 1.
