<A NAME="edr"><H3>EDR</H3></A>
<pre>
This parameter specifies the names of 1-25 input EDR files,
containing the data from which the cube will be generated. 

NIMS EDR files can be obtained from the PDS imaging node, as follows
(as of 19 June 2008):

1. Go to http://www-pdsimage.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/onlineData.html
2. Under "Sorted by Mission", click on "NIMS EDRs".
3. Find the encounter needed and click on the appropriate icon.

The EDRs and their detached VICAR labels are in subdirectories of
the "target" directories.  Both are needed and the labels must be
attached to the EDR proper, before inputting to nimscmm2.  E.g.,
the files g7g002.edr and g7g002.vic can be retrieved from their
respective directories and then merged by the Unix command:

% cat g7g002.vic g7g002.edr &gt g7g002.EDR

which generates the VICAR-labelled EDR file g7g002.EDR.

The PDS filenames can be correlated to the NIMS observations by
information in the files in the "index" directory of the dataset.

Note that, at the time of writing, the NIMS EDRs are also online at
MIPL in the directory /project/gll/nims/edr/pb.  However, it is not
certain how long they will remain there.  These EDRs have the original
filenames based on the observation name, not the shortened versions
that were delivered to PDS.  E.g., the EDR listed above, g7g002.edr,
corresponds to g7gnglobal01a.11 in this location.

<hr>
<A NAME="cube"><H3>CUBE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the filename for the cube generated by NIMSCMM2, 
 which will be a three-dimensional image file of size NS*NL*NB
 numbers.  The format will be halfword if CALTYP=NOCAL is specified,
 otherwise floating-point (unless RADSCAL&gt0 is specified).

 The spatial dimensions NS and NL may be set by the OUTSIZ parameter,
 otherwise they will be computed automaticall using SCALE.  The
 spectral dimension, NB, is determined from the intrument mode as
 read from the EDR.  However, the user may override this and specify
 that only one band be produced, using the OUTBAND parameter.

 Note that if the cube is a "tube" file, then the output size is
 determined in a very different manner:  NS = number of mirror
 positions (normally 20), and NL = number of grating cycles.  See
 parameter OUTTYPE.

 The ISIS "special pixel value" convention is used to flag pixels
 with unusual circumstances, e.g., missing data, saturation.  See
 "Special Pixels Values" under Help.
 During Galileo systematic processing, the cube names were required
 to be of the form:

 Observation-name + Observation-extension + "_" + Initials + Mosaic-number

 where:
 Observation-name is a 12-character string starting with the Orbit
 designation (G1,G2,C3,...31,32,33),
 Observation-extension is a one-character designation (A,B,C,...),
 Initials is a 3-character string designating the person responsible
 for the cube or "MSY" for a delivered Systematic product,
 Mosaic-number is a two-digit number to make the name unique.

 The filetype designated the type of cube, e.g., ".QUB" for projected
 radiance cube, ".VTUB" for radiance tube, etc.

 E.g.: G1ENGLOBAL01A_MSY04.QUB for a Europa global mosaic from the
 first orbit, 33JNGLOBAL01A_MSY01.VTUB for a Jupiter global mosaic
 from the last orbit.

 Unfortunately, PDS at that time had a requirement of 8.3-format file
 names, so the delivered cubes have different names;  the two examples
 cited above were changed as follows:
 G1ENGLOBAL01A_MSY04.QUB became G1E002CR.QUB,
 33JNGLOBAL01A_MSY01.VTUB became 33J001TI.QUB.
 The original names can be found in the labels of the delivered cubes
 under the PRODUCT_ID keyword and also in files in the Index directories
 of PDS.

 In the current version of the program, the CUBE parameter is completely
 unconstrained, users are free to make up their own names.

<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outtype"><H3>OUTTYPE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the type of cube the program should generate.
 Note the following definitions:
  "Cube" = any three-dimensional file.
  "G-cube" = a cube in which the first two dimensions are map-projection
          space (geometrically resampled) and the third is band.
  "Tube" = a cube in which the first two dimensions are instrument space
          (defined below) and the third is band.
  "P-Tube" = same as "Tube", but with pointing data in the cotube.

 Specifying "TUBE" for this parameter specifies that the output cube
 should be a tube file.  In this option, the sample direction follows the
 motion of the scanning mirror, while the line direction is along the scan
 platform motion.  Thus, the 3 dimensions correspond to:

 1 (sample )= mirror motion (always 1 or 20)
 2 (line)   = grating cycle
 3 (bands)  = same as cube file.

 The mirror UP position corresponds to sample = 20 and DOWN is sample = 1.
 Note that in Fixed mode (only) data taken in mirrow WAIT state are also
 projected;  these data are not reversed, so they will show up as an 
 anomaly in the regular reversal of the chop count in the last band of
 the co-tube (see HELP COCUBE).

 The default, "GCUBE", is to generate a projected cube, in which the first
 two dimensions correspond to the two dimensions of a spatial map.

 Note that under the TUBE option, the weights file (parameter WTFIL) is
 not used, and the cocube is significantly changed (see parameter COCUBE). 
 Furthermore, in this case the following parameters are not used:  OUTDETS,
 OUTBAND, SDBAND, SDGEO, and FILL.  (Although OUTSIZ is used, it applies
 to the size of the map projection, so does not affect the tube dimensions,
 but just the [line, sample] planes in the co-cube.)

 The program will still perform a map projection for the TUBE option, but
 the pixels will not be stored in the map-projected locations;  instead
 the projected (Line,Sample) values will be stored in the cocube, which
 is greatly expanded in size over the G-cube case (see parameter COCUBE). 
 Since the Line and Sample values stored in the cocube are floating point
 rather than integer, and since DN values falling into the same projected
 pixels are not averaged, the information content of the tube file is
 actually far greater than of the G-cube.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outorg"><H3>OUTORG</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the organization of the output cube. 
 Possible choices are:

 BSQ (band sequential):  the order of the pixels in the file is
   Sample (varying fastest) - Line - Band (varying slowest),

 BIL (band interleaved by line):  the order is Sample - Band - Line,

 BIP (band interleaved by pixel):  the order is Band - Sample - Line.

 The normal Vicar standard is BSQ, which is the default value for
 NIMSCMM2.  However, because the input data are processed in order of
 detector, this leads to swapping and extremely inefficient program
 performance in FULL or LONG mode (204 or 408 bands), when the
 spatial area (NL*NS) is large.  This can be considerably remedied
 by specifying another file organization, especially BIP.

 The Fill algorithm will only work on BSQ files, therefore if BIP or
 BIL is specified, FILL is disabled. 

 This parameter is not used under the TUBE option.

 (Note that the COCUBE file is always BSQ.)

 THIS OPTION IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR RADIANCE SCALING

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cocube"><H3>COCUBE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the filename for the "geometry co-cube" produced by NIMSCMM2.
 For the default G-cube option, this consists of 9 bands containing:

 1 = latitude (planetocentric or planetographic, depending on LAT_TYPE)
 2 = longitude (west for all allowed TARGETs except Venus, which has east)
 3 = incidence angle
 4 = emission angle
 5 = <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle
 6 = "slant distance", in km
 7 = height above planet (expanded-radius only, see below), in km
 8 = standard deviation for one of bands 3-7 (see parameter SDGEO)
 9 = standard deviation for one cube band (see parameter SDBAND).

 (For the TUBE option the structure is quite different, see below.)

 The format of this cocube is REAL.  Pixels containing no data are
 assigned the value Null, see Special Pixel Values under Help.

 Band 6 (slant distance) is the distance from the spacecraft to the
 target body surface intercept point.  For most projections, the value
 written to this backplane is the weighted mean of the actual slant
 distances for all input pixels contributing to this projected pixel. 
 However, for the Perspective projetion, it is the slant distance from
 the standard perspective point of the projection;  this can be used
 (together with the FOV) to obtain the linear dimension of the
 projected pixel in this projectionn.  In this case, to obtain the
 actual slant distance at the instant of observation, one must 
 examine the corresponding co-tube.

 Band 7 (height) is only of significance when the expanded-radius option
 is used (parameter RADFACT).  In this option, a pixel falling off the
 planet for the normal radius is reprojected using an expanded radius.
 The DN of band 7 then has the following significance:
  If the pixel falls on the planet normally: DN = 0.0.
  If the pixel is projected using expanded radius: DN = height above
   surface.
 Completely off-planet pixels have the Null value, as for all other planes.

 Note that longitudes in the cocube/cotube are east for Venus, following
 IAU convention;  the same is true for all longitude parameters.  However,
 the longitudes in the Vicar label are always west, even for Venus, for
 compatibility with Vicar software.

 If parameter COCUBE is defaulted, the name is constructed out of the
 cube name by adding the filetype ".COC" for a G-cube (default), or 
 ".COT" for a tube file.

 The incidence and emission angles are computed from the vectors to
 sun and spacecraft at the target-body surface.  However, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle
 is computed between the LOS (negated) at the spacecraft and the solar
 vector.  This means that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle is defined even when the LOS
 misses the target body, which can be an advantage when observing targets
 such as rings or upper atmosphere.  There is a small error, in that the
 solar vector is reckoned from the spacecraft rather than the target, but
 this is negligible in most cases.

 For the TUBE file option, there are no standard deviation bands, and
 latitude, longitude, line, sample are stored for each grating position.
 (Line and sample refer to location of the pixel when map-projected.)
 When the Footprint option has been selected, then two extra bands are
 stored for each grating position, viz., line/sample of right edge.
 The exact structure for this option is:

 NBPG*(G-1)+1 = latitude for g.p. = G
 NBPG*(G-1)+2 = longitude for g.p. = G
 NBPG*(G-1)+3 = line for g.p. = G
 NBPG*(G-1)+4 = sample for g.p. = G
 NBPG*(G-1)+5 = line of right edge for g.p. = G (Footprint only)
 NBPG*(G-1)+6 = sample of right edge for g.p. = G (Footprint only)
 NBPG*NG+1 = incidence angle
 NBPG*NG+2 = emission angle
 NBPG*NG+3 = <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle
 NBPG*NG+4 = "slant distance", in km
 NBPG*NG+5 = height above planet, in km,
 NBPG*NG+6 = time in chops after the beginning of the observation, as given by
          the BEG_SCLK label item.  This is written for the first step in
          the grating cycle (only).  In a tube, BEG_SCLK is always set to
          the beginning of a grating cycle, so the first line of the cotube 
          always (except for Fixed mode) contains 19,...,0.
          (NOTE: 1 chop = 1 mirror step = 1/21 mirror scan = 1/42 minor frame)

 where:
 NBPG = 4 if not Footprint, 6 if Footprint,
 G (grating position) = 1,...,NG,
 and NG can range from 1 (Fixed mode) to 24 (Long mode).

 (For Long mode with Footprint there will be 150 bands in the cotube!)
 For a P-Tube cotube (P-cotube), the following bands are added:

 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+1 = Right Ascension for (g.p. = G)
 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+2 = Declination for (g.p. = G)
 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+3 = Twist for (g.p. = G)
 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+4 = X-component of vector from S/C to Target for (g.p. = G)
 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+5 = Y-component of vector from S/C to Target for (g.p. = G)
 NBPG*(G-1)+NBPG0+6 = Z-component of vector from S/C to Target for (g.p. = G)

 where NBPG0 is the NBPG of the "standard" case, and NBPG = NBPG0+6.

 (For Long mode with Footprint a P-cotube will have 294 bands.)

 The extra bands for the P-cotube contain the geometry extracted from
 the NAIF SPICE kernels and interpolated to the mirror position.

 Right Ascension, Declination, and Twist are the three Euler angles
 defining the pointing matrices in the C-kernels.  (Note that the
 Galileo C-kernels use a different definition of Twist than was
 used for Voyager:  Twist(VGR) = Twist(GLL) - 90.  The GLL Twist
 is the one stored here.)

 The other stored quantity is the vector from the spacecraft to the
 target body center.  (This is the inverse of the normal "RS-vector)
 used by VICAR software.)

 All these quantities are in the B1950 system, per the Galileo project
 standard.

<hr>
<A NAME="target"><H3>TARGET</H3></A><pre>
 TARGET specifies the name of the target body being observed.

 A special case is TARGET=CALIBRATION, in which there really is no valid
 target body.  This may only be used in the Tube option, and a dummy
 AACSFILE must be supplied (created by program CRDA).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delrad"><H3>DELRAD</H3></A><pre>
 DELRAD specifies a correction to the radius of the target body obtained
 from the SPICE interface, which will normally be used to account for
 the effect of an atmosphere.  (Note that this effect is in principle
 wavelength-dependent, although the program cannot take account of this!)

 DELRAD is specified in km.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="calfile"><H3>CALFILE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the name of the calibration files supplied by the NIMS team
 for this MM.  Usually one file suffices, but if the Gain state changed
 during the observation, then multiple EDRs will have been generated, some
 with differing Gains in their headers.  In this case, the user has the
 option to merge them all into a single cube by specifying different
 calibration files, one for each Gain state.  It is required that, if more
 than one Cal files are supplied, the number of Cal files be exactly the
 same as the number of EDRs, and they be in the same order;  i.e., for
 the Nth EDR, the program will use the Nth Cal files.  This may mean that
 the same Cal file is repeated in the list.

 It is needed even if no calibration is requested (CALTYPE = NOCAL) because
 it is also used to calculate wavelengths.

 NOTE:  there are two types of Cal and Dark files, binary and ascii.  For
 most of the mission, binary files were used, but only the ascii versions
 were archived (though they were not delivered to PDS).  The program assumes
 that the Cal file is binary, unless the filename contains the string ".tab"
 or ".TAB", or the keyword ASC_CAL was specified (which is the default).

 The ascii Cal files are online on Mipl in /project/gll/nims/cal.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pshift"><H3>PSHIFT</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the grating correction to be used in calculating the
wavelengths.  Normally, the value in the CALFILE is used, but if the
user specifies this parameter, that value is overridden.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ainfl"><H3>AINFL</H3></A><pre>
The grating step inflation correction, like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#pshift">PSHIFT</A>, a parameter that was
added when the NIMS wavelength calibration began to degrade.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="darkfile"><H3>DARKFILE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the name of the dark files supplied by the NIMS team
 for this MM.  It is not needed if CALTYPE = NOCAL, i.e., no radiometric
 calibration is requested.  Like for the CALFILE, multiple dark files
 for one cube are possible.

 NOTE:  there are two types of Cal and Dark files, binary and ascii.  For
 most of the mission, binary files were used, but only the ascii versions
 were archived (though they were not delivered to PDS).  The program assumes
 that the Cal file is binary, unless the filename contains the string ".tab"
 or ".TAB", or the keyword ASC_CAL was specified (which is the default).

 The ascii Dark files are online on Mipl in /project/gll/nims/dark.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dbmfile"><H3>DBMFILE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the name of the boom obscuration map file supplied by the 
 NIMS team.  It is used to identify boom-obscured pixels and omit them
 from processing.  The default value for this parameter is the standard 
 Galileo boom map as seen from NIMS.

 To turn off boom-obscuration checking, enter null ("--") or DUMMY_DBM.DAT
 for this parameter.

 Note that the cone/clock angles used for the boom obscuration correction
 are require both a Platform and a Rotor [NOT IMPLEMENTED!] C-kernel,
 or equivalently an AACS-file.  (See parameter CSOURCE.)  If a Predict
 C-kernel is supplied, then boom correction cannot be performed, as there
 are no Predict rotor kernels.

 The Boom Obscuration files are online on Mipl in /project/gll/nims/misc.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dspkfile"><H3>DSPKFILE</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the name of the despike file supplied by the NIMS team
for this MM.  

NIMS spike files can be obtained from the PDS imaging node, as follows
(as of 10 Sep. 2010):

1. Go to http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/onlineData.html
2. Under "Sorted by Mission", click on "NIMS EDRs".
3. Find the encounter needed and click on the appropriate icon.

The spike files are in parallel subdirectory to that of the EDRs, under
the "target" directories.  Note that not all EDRs have associated spike
files.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solfile"><H3>SOLFILE</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the name of the file containing the mean intensity at
 the solar surface, which is used only if Radiance calibration is
 performed (CALTYPE=RAD).  In this case, the mean incident solar flux
 on the target body will be computed and written to the label for use
 in scaling the radiances.

 The default for this parameter is a file containing a standard solar
 spectrum from Allen, "Astrophysical Quantities", 3rd ed., which should
 be adequate for most purposes.

 Note:  the intensities in this file must be in cgs units, i.e.,
 erg/cm^2/sec/sterad/mu.  However, the solar fluxes written to the
 label will be in the "mixed" units:  uWatt/cm^2/mu, consistent with
 those used for cube radiances.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sdfil"><H3>SDFIL</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the name of on optional cube containing "standard 
deviations" (actually, square roots of the variances) for all cube
pixels.  These are defined as:
 SD = &ltDN**2&gt - <DN>**2
where the quantities on the RHS are defined under Help WTFIL.

This parameter is ignored if the Tube option is used.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wtfil"><H3>WTFIL</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the name of the file in which the weights and squares
 are stored for the computation of mean output quantities and standard
 deviations.  By default, this filename has no extension and the file is
 therefore temporary, with the Vicar2 default extension of ".Znn" (where
 nn are the final digits of the process id).  By specifying an explicit
 file extension, the user can cause this file to be saved.

 The weights file is not used in the TUBE option.

 This file contains, for each spatial pixel containing valid data:
  - NGP bands (one for each grating position) containing the DN weight, WDN, 
  - one band containing the weight for the geometry data, WG, 
  - one band containing the mean of the square of the co-cube band SDGEO,
  - one band containing the mean of the square of the cube band SDBAND.
 (For definitions of these quantities, see below.  SDGEO and SDBAND are
 user parameters.)

 NGP, the number of grating positions, is normally NB/17.  Since weights
 are floating-point numbers, this yields a total file size of:
      NL * NS * (NB/17 + 3) * 4 bytes,
 where NL, NS, NB are the line/sample/band dimensions of the output cube.

 (Of course if NB=1 because the user specified the OUTBAND parameter, then
 the above factor of 1/17 vanishes and the temporary file is 8 times as big
 as the output "cube", which is in this case just a 2-D image.)

 DEFINITION OF QUANTITIES IN WEIGHTS FILE:

 Each output DN in the merged mosaic is the weighted mean of all contributing
 input data, formed as follows:

      ODNlsj = &ltIDN&gt = SUMi( Wilsj * IDNi) / SUMi( Wilsj)

 where:
 ODNlsj = DN for output pixel at line l, sample s, band j,
 IDNi = DN for input comb i,
 Wilsj = contribution of i to (l,s,j),
 SUMi is a notation signifying summation over index i,
 and this equation serves to define the notation &ltX&gt used below. 

 (A "comb" is an array of 17 detector DNs for a given grating position, 
 all of which have an identical geometry.)

 The quantities in the first NGP bands of the weights file are the
 denominator of the above equation:

    WDNlsj = SUMi( Wilsj)

 (This will apply to all 17 output bands corresponding to the given grating
 position.)

 The the mapping of i to (l,s) is a complicated function that is performed
 by the map projection routines.  (For this reason, the limits of the
 summation cannot be explicitly given in the above equation.)  In the
 nearest-neighbour algorithm the weight W is 1 for the single output location
 it maps to, and 0 for all others;  therefore each WDN is simply the number
 of input combs contributing to that location.  In the footprint algorithm
 the weights can be fractional, but the sum of the weights for one input
 comb is unity.  See parameter BIN.

 The same algorithm is used to compute means of geometric angles and
 squares, see parameter COCUBE.  For these quantities, the summation is
 over all grating positions as well as all combs, so that the corresponding
 weight is the sum of all the preceding band weights for that spatial
 location:

    WGls = SUMj( WDNlsj),  j=1,...,NGP.

 In the nearest-neighbout algorithm, this sum is then the number of all
 combs falling into this (l,s) location anywhere in the cube.

 The standard deviation (SD) of a quantity X is computed by the equation:

      SD**2 = &ltX**2&gt - <X>**2

 (Note that this is not strictly the classical standard deviation, but
 rather the square root of the variance.  For large samples, these two
 quantities are practically identical.)

 The last 2 bands of the weights file contain the quantities &ltSG**2&gt and
 &ltSDN**2&gt, where SG = one of bands 3-7 of the cocube (see parameter SDGEO),
 and SDN = a band of the cube (see parameter SDBAND).

<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="phase"><H3>PHASE</H3></A><pre>
 Name of the mission <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> -- this is needed as a label item only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="obsname"><H3>OBSNAME</H3></A><pre>
 Name of the observation -- this is obtained from the NIMS request form
 and is needed as a label item.  It is also used, together with MOS_NUM,
 to construct the cube file name (by SYSNIMS.PDF) and the PRODUCT_ID
 label item, as follows:

  PRODUCT_ID = OBSNAME // "_MSY" // seq_no

 where seq_no is a 2-digit expansion of MOS_NUM: "1" becomes "01",
 "A" becomes "10", "B" becomes "11", etc.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mos_num"><H3>MOS_NUM</H3></A><pre>
 Mosaic number, which is used to identify the product in cases where
 more than one cubes are generated for a given observation.  It is used
 to generate the cube name and PRODUCT_ID label item, together with
 OBSNAME.  See HELP OBSNAME for more details.

 MOS_NUM should identify products in the sequence:
   1, 2, 3,.., 9, A, B, C, ... Z.
 Thus, 35 different products for a given observation are allowed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="obsnote"><H3>OBSNOTE</H3></A><pre>
 Observation note - this is obtained from the NIMS request form
 and is an optional label item.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="suppnote"><H3>SUPPNOTE</H3></A><pre>
This is any optional supplementary text to the OBSNOTE, which will appear
in the cube label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="prodnote"><H3>PRODNOTE</H3></A><pre>
 Product note - this is obtained from the NIMS request form
 and is an optional label item.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="prodid"><H3>PRODID</H3></A><pre>
 Product identification - this should be identical to the output cube
 name.  If NIMSCMM2 is run from SYSNIMS, PRODID will be constructed as
 follows:

   PRODID = OBSNAME // "_" // INITIALS // SEQ_NO

 where SEQ_NO is a 3-digit number that is generated from the last
 character of OBSNAME, if this is alphabetic (A-Z).

 If PRODID is defaulted, then NIMSCMM2 will attempt this construction
 itself.  However, in this case there is no guarantee that this will be
 the cube name.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="initials"><H3>INITIALS</H3></A><pre>
 A 3-letter code that will be used to generate the PRODID label item and
 output Cube names.   This is supposed to identify the person primarily
 responsible for the cube.

 If NIMSCMM2 is run from SYSNIMS, then the default value for this will be 
 MSY (= MIPS Systematic Processing), which should not normally be changed.

 NOTE:  as of 03apr01, using INITIALS=MSY will turn off certain fixes to
 nimscmm2 which are not intended to be applied to Systematic products.
 Any other value will invoke these fixes.  This can be overridden by
 specifying the keyword OLD_VER.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="old_ver"><H3>OLD_VER</H3></A><pre>
 This keyword specifies that nimscmm2 should be run without using two
 fixes made in 2000-2001, which would cause cosmetic changes in the
 Nims systematic products which could confuse users without adding
 significant value.  (The changes are to the cylindrical projection
 for Jupiter, and to thes slant-distance backplane for the Perspective
 case.)  Normally this will be controlled by the INITIALS parameter
(q.v.), but this keyword provides a means of overriding it.
 (If 'OLD_VER is specified, then the changes will *not* be used.)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="caltype"><H3>CALTYPE</H3></A><pre>
 Type of calibration for output data.  The following choices exist:

 NOCAL = uncalibrated, raw DN.
 RAD = radiance (units: uWatt/cm^2/sterad/mu).

 When RAD is specified, the solar flux will be written to the label for use
 in scaling (see parameter SOLFILE), with units of uWatt/cm^2/mu.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="radscal"><H3>RADSCAL</H3></A><pre>
 Selects whether radiance scaling is performed.  (It only has meaning when
 CALTYP=RAD.)  This parameter is obsolete and the default value of 0 should
 always be used.

 RADSCAL=0:  radiances will not be scaled.  This is the default value.
 RADSCAL=1:  radiances will be scaled dynamically to the halfword range with
  band-dependent base and multipliers.
 RADSCAL=2:  radiances will be scaled to the halfword range using preset band-
  dependent base and multipliers, which are read in from the calibration file.
 RADSCAL=3:  the radiances will be scaled to the halfword range using a single
  base and multiplier, which are read in from the calibration file.

 In addition, the following option is supported for special test purposes
 only (NOT to be selected for standard processing):
 RADSCAL=-1:  this is actually a DN cube, which is output in floating-point
  in order to preserve accuracy of averaging;  it is labelled a 'radiance
  cube' because all the s/w expects DN data to be integer.  If a Dark File
  is specified in this option, then dark values will be subtracted from the
  data.

 If RADSCAL&lt=0 the output cube data format will be REAL (4-byte floating-
 point).  Otherwise it will be HALF (2-byte integer).

 CAUTION!  When a photometric correction is applied, (see parameter PHOTFUNC)
 it is possible to obtain radiances that would exceed the detector saturation
 limit if observed directly;  therefore, the precomputed scaling factors used
 by default may be invalid.  For such cubes, no scaling (RADSCAL=0) or
 dynamical scaling (RADSCAL=1) is recommended.

<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="darktype"><H3>DARKTYPE</H3></A><pre>
 Type of dark interpolation used in the calibration.

 (Not yet implemented.)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="drkthrsh"><H3>DRKTHRSH</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies a threshold below which to omit data as being
 most likely part of the sky (dark) background.  It is specified in terms
 of the dark value read in from the DARKFILE, e.g. DRKTHRSH=1.1 means
 that all pixels with DN less than 10% above the DARK value are omitted
 (set to NULL).

 This parameter is intended to help clean up the limb when using the
 Footprint algorithm.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="photfunc"><H3>PHOTFUNC</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the photometric function used to correct for effects of
 viewing angle.  The options are:

 NOPCOR:  no correction, raw DN is output.
 LAMBERTF:  f = cos(I)
 LOMMEL:    f = cos(I) / (cos(I) + cos(E))
 MINNAERT:  f = cos(I)**k * cos(E)**(k-1)

 This correction is applied only for wavelengths less than the value
 specified by parameter PHOTCUT.

 If MINNAERT is specified, then the exponential term "k" is determined
 by parameter MINN_EXP.

 (LAMBERTF has the final F to distinguish this keyword from the otherwise
 identical one under Projection.)

 (LOMMEL actually invokes the Lommel-Seeliger function, but this was
 shortened as a keyword for the sake of simplicity.)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="photcut"><H3>PHOTCUT</H3></A><pre>
 Cutoff wavelength for the photometric correction specified by parameter
 PHOTFUNC.  This should correspond to the highest wavelength at which there
 is significant incident sunlight in the data.

 The default (NULL in the PDF) is to use PHOTCUT=4.0 for Jupiter, and
 5.3 (i.e., all NIMS wavelengths) for other targets.

 This parameter is ignored if no function is specified under PHOTFUNC.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="minn_exp"><H3>MINN_EXP</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the exponential term "k" in the Minnaert
 photometric function, see parameter PHOTFUNC.  It is ignored if
 PHOTFUNC is not MINNAERT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="inccut"><H3>INCCUT</H3></A><pre>
Cutoff incidence angle (degrees):  all pixels with incidence angles 
greater than this value are omitted from the mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="emicut"><H3>EMICUT</H3></A><pre>
Cutoff emission angle (degrees):  all pixels with emission angles 
greater than this value are omitted from the mosaic.
 
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="proj"><H3>PROJ</H3></A><pre>
 PROJ specifies the desired map projection. Valid projection keywords
 are:
  MERCATOR 
  CYLINDRI = simple cylindrical (or rectangular)
  NORMCYL = normal cylindrical
  SINUSOID = sinusoidal equal area
  LAMBERT = Lambert conformal conic
  STEREO = oblique stereographic
  POLSTER = polar stereographic
  ORTHO = oblique orthographic
  POLORTH = polar orthographic
  POV = point of view, or "object space"
  PERSPECT = perspective, synonym for POV

 Choosing a projection can imply that certain projection parameters
 are treated in a special fashion.  In particular, TIELAT, TIELON,
 TIELINE, and TIESAMP specify the so-called "special point" which
 all projections require.  For some projections this is just an
 arbitrary tiepoint, but others have a specific interpretation or
 constraint on these:

  CYLINDRI, NORMCYL, and SINUSOIDAL requires that the special point lie on
   the equator, i.e., TIELAT=0 is assumed (any user specification is ignored).

  MERCATOR requires that TIELINE = TIESAMP = 1 (any other specification
   will be ignored).

  POLSTER & POLORTH require that the special point be a pole, i.e.,
   |TIELAT|=90; furthermore, this point is the center of projection. If
   the user omits TIELAT, then the pole nearest to the bulk of the image
   data is used.  If TIELON is omitted, a default of 0 is used.

  ORTHO does not impose a constraint on the special point, but it will
   be the center of projection.

  LAMBERT:  this projection requires 2 standard parallels to be specified
   using the PARALLEL parameter (which is ignored for all other projections).

  POV/PERSPECT: in this projection the viewing geometry may be specified 
   by the REFSCLK parameter if the point of view is an actual scan platform
   position during the observation.  If not, then the user must specify
   the full viewing geometry by hand, which means all of the following
   parameters (note that for this projection "TIE" refers to the sub-
   spacecraft point):
     TIELAT, TIELON, NORTH, PDIST, 
     plus either:  TIELINE and TIESAMP,
     or:  OLATLON.
   The line and sample position of the optical axis may also be specified
   by the OAXIS parameter, and the output image size by OUTSIZ.  However,
   if the user does not know these values from a previous run, then it is
   simplest to let the program compute them from the extent of the data.
   (OUTSIZ is not really a projection parameter, but if not specified the
   program will revise OAXIS & TIELINE/SAMP in the course of calculating
   the size, unless NORECENT[er] is specified.)  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tielat"><H3>TIELAT</H3></A><pre>
 TIELAT specifies the special latitude point for map projection from
 latitude-longitude space to line-sample space.

 If projection is Polar Stereographic or Orthographic, this parameter is
 ignored:  the pole nearest to the data is found automatically and used.
 If projection is Cylindrical or Sinusoidal, it is also ignored and
 the equator (tielat=0.0) is used.
 Otherwise, this defaults to the central latitude of the data.
 It may also be specified by the REFSCLK parameter for some projections.

 TIELAT ranges from -90 to 90, and is either planetocentric or
 planetodetic, depending on the LAT_TYPE parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tielon"><H3>TIELON</H3></A><pre>
 TIELON specifies the special longitude point for map projection
 from latitude-longitude space to line-sample space.
 It may also be specified by the REFSCLK parameter for some projections.

 If projection is Polar Stereographic or Orthographic, TIELON specifies the
 longitude that is "up" in the image.  In this case, the default is 0.

 If projection is Cylindrical, this longitude will be in the center
 of the output mosaic.

 TIELON ranges from 0 to 360.  It is West for all bodies except for Venus,
 for which East longitude is used following IAU convention.

 (Note that the Vicar cube label will show a West tiepoint longitude even
 for Venus, per Vicar convention, but the final ISIS cube will have East
 longitude in this case.)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tieline"><H3>TIELINE</H3></A><pre>
 TIELIN is the line location of the "special point", corresponding to the
 point specified by TIELAT and TIELON.  If defaulted, the center of the
 data will be used.

 If projection is MERCATOR, then the special point is always at (1,1),
 and any other specification is ignored.

 If the projection is PERSPECTIVE, then the actual value of this parameter
 in the output map labels may differ from the specified value by some small
 amount (of order 0.0001 or less of the value), due to use of single-precision
 data in some processing steps.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tiesamp"><H3>TIESAMP</H3></A><pre>
 TIESAMP is the sample location of "special point", corresponding to the
 point specified by TIELAT and TIELON.  If defaulted, the center of the
 data will be used.

 If projection is MERCATOR, then the special point is always at (1,1),
 and any other specification is ignored.

 If the projection is PERSPECTIVE, then the actual value of this parameter
 in the output map labels may differ from the specified value by some small
 amount (of order 0.0001 or less of the value), due to use of single-precision
 data in some processing steps.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="north"><H3>NORTH</H3></A><pre>
 This allows the user to specify the North angle (measured clockwise
 from "up") for Oblique projections (Orthographic/Stereographic), or
 for Perspective if the user is specifying the parameters explicitly
 (as opposed to by the REFSCLK parameter).

 Default = 0., i.e., North is pointing straight up in the image.

 If "null" (--) is entered for this parameter, then the north angle
 of the original data (evaluated at the midpoint of the observation)
 is used.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="parallel"><H3>PARALLEL</H3></A><pre>
 PARALLEL specifies the latitudes of two standard parallels for Lambert
 projection.  This parameter is ignored for all other parameters.  

 If no values are specified for this parameter by the user, the program
 uses the following defaults:

    PARALLEL = (59.17, 35.83)

 or the negative of these values if the center of projection is in the
 Southren hemisphere.

 The parallels range from -90 to 90, and are either planetocentric or
 planetodetic, depending on the LAT_TYPE parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="refsclk"><H3>REFSCLK</H3></A><pre>
 REFSCLK specifies the s/c time (SCLK) which is to be the reference
 point for the map projection.  It is defined as follows:
    REFSCLK(1) = 100*RIM + MOD91
 (This time can be made more precise by using the parameter REFMP.)

 The subspacecraft point at the time specified by REFSCLK is taken as the
 center of projection, and is an alternative way of specifying the TIELAT,
 TIELON parameters.  REFSCLK is ignored if the projection is Cylindrical,
 Sinusoidal, Mercator, or Polar Stereographic or Orthographic, as these
 have their own conventions for the "special point".

 For POV/PERSPECT projection, REFSCLK determines not only the sub-space-
 craft point, but also the distance to planet center and the optical
 axis direction.  If a point of view outside the actual range of scan
 platform positions during the observation is desired, then the user
 must specify the full viewing geometry by hand, see HELP PROJ.
 Also, OLATLON may be specified in conjunction with REFSCLK, in which
 case the latter only determines the sub-spacecraft point, while the
 former determines the optical axis position (OM-matrix).

 If the full viewing geometry is not specified, and REFSCLK is also
 omitted, a default value of REFSCLK midway between the extreme SCLK
 values in the input EDRs is used.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="refmp"><H3>REFMP</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter is only used if REFSCLK has been specified (q.v.), in which
 case it specifies the mirror position (MP) inside the RIM and MOD91 of the
 latter parameter.  Note that MP ranges from 0 to 39, and there are 4 MP
 per MOD10 (or RTI).

 REFMP defaults to 9, halfway in the first mirror scan of the MOD91.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="oaxis"><H3>OAXIS</H3></A><pre>
 This allows user specification of the optical axis line and sample for
 Perspective projection.  (It is ignored for other projections.)  This
 need not not normally be specified by the user, as the program computes
 it from the extent of the valid data in the image, unless 'NORECENT[er]
 is specified.  However, if OAXIS is known from a previous run with the
 same projection, then specifying it and OUTSIZ will save cpu time.  In
 this case, the full viewing geometry must be specified (see POV/PERSPECTIVE
 under HELP PROJ).

 The exact location of the optical axis in the image plane is fairly
 immaterial, unless it is offset from the target body center by an amount
 that is of the order of or greater than the NIMS focal length, which is
 2000 pixels:  in that case, the effect will be to distort the body being
 observed along the line connecting the optical axis to the body center
 (subspacecraft point);  e.g., a spherical body will appear as an ellipse.
 (The optical axis does NOT have to be in the image!)   Note that the
 effective focal length is changed by the SCALE parameter:  an increased
 SCALE corresponds to a shorter focal length, which will increase the
 effects of an offset in the optical axis from the target body center.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="olatlon"><H3>OLATLON</H3></A><pre>
 This allows user specification of the optical axis latitude and longitude
 for Perspective projection.  (It is ignored for other projections.)  This
 parameter gives the user more control over the output projection than the
 TIELIN, TIESAM parameters, which are hard to estimate ahead of time.
 (However, OAXIS is better suited for a case where one is trying to reproduce
 a previous result, in which the optical axis location is specified by Line/
 Sample in the map labels.)  

 Note that this parameter only allows an optical axis that intersects the
 target body surface.  See discussion of the optical axis under the OAXIS
 parameter.

 OLATLON may either be specified along with all the other viewing geometry
 parameters (see PERSPECTIVE/POV under HELP PROJ), or it may be used along
 with the REFSCLK parameter.  In the latter case, REFSCLK will only be used
 to determine the RS-vector, while the OM-matrix will come from OLATLON.

 As with other longitude parameters, OLATLON(2) is West longitude for all
 bodies except Venus, for which it is East per IAU convention.
 OLATLON(1) ranges from -90 to 90, and is either planetocentric or
 planetodetic, depending on the LAT_TYPE parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="recenter"><H3>RECENTER</H3></A><pre>
 If RECENTER is specified, then the program will shift the optical axis
 (OAXIS parameter) to center the data in the image.  Otherwise, the
 user-specified optical axis will be retained.  (It is possible that
 the user entered an arbitrary optical axis in order to complete the
 viewing geometry requirements of MOMATI.)

 The default is to recenter, unless the user specified both OUTSIZ and
 OAXIS.  (If the user did not specify OAXIS, the program uses an initial
 guess of (0,0), and always recenters;  the RECENTER parameter is not
 checked in this case.)

 (POV/PERSPECT only)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pdist"><H3>PDIST</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the S/C-Planet distance ("range") for POV/PERSPECT
 projection, in km.  (It is ignored for other projections.)  It is
 not needed if REFSCLK has been specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sclk"><H3>SCLK</H3></A><pre>
 SCLK specifies a list of pairs of numbers, which represent a series
 of beginning and ending SCLK values.   Only cube data inside these
 intervals will be used for the mosaic.

 Each SCLK value in this list specifies a RIM and MOD91 count, as
 follows:

    SCLK = 100*RIM + MOD91

 If either the beginning or the ending SCLK of an interval is 0,
 then the program will use the earliest or latest SCLK in the input
 data, respectively.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="radii"><H3>RADII</H3></A><pre>
 RADII allows the user to override the target body radii in the SPICE
 kernels.  The three values are the axes of a tri-axial ellipsoid, in
 the following order:
 (Semi-Major Equatorial Axis, Semi-Minor Equatorial Axis, Polar Axis).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="radfact"><H3>RADFACT</H3></A><pre>
 RADFACT specifies a radius expansion factor for pixels that fall off
 the planet for the nominal radius (including the DELRAD correction).
 It is only usable for projections which allow off-limb regions to be
 displayed, currently only POV/PERSPECT and Orthographic.  Some applications
 for this include atmospheric limb data, nearby bodies, or data rendered
 off-planet by pointing errors.  

 RADFACT is specified as a multiplicative factor to the nominal radius
 supplied by SPICE.  E.g., if RADFACT=1.5 and the radius from SPICE is
 6000 km, then the expanded radius" is 9000 km.  This is actually an
 upper limit to the radius expansion used, see next paragraph.

 When RADFACT &gt 0.0 is specified, then for every pixel falling off
 the planet, a second projection is attempted using a larger radius.
 The new radius is the tangent radius to the line of sight from the
 planet center, assuming that this does not exceed the expanded radius.
 If this succeeds in putting the pixel on-planet, then the DN is
 written out normally but the increase in radius is written to the
 corresponding location in plane 7 of the cocube, which indicates
 that the value is "fudged".

 Some points that fall barely off-limb may turn out to be "back-of-
 planet" and therefore still not be projectable, depending on where 
 the projection viewpoint is taken.  This can be remedied by changing
 the viewing perspective, using the REFSCLK parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
 For true map projections (i.e., all values of the PROJ parameter
 except for POV/PERSPECT), SCALE specifies the number of kilometers per
 pixel at some special point of the projection plane.  The special
 point varies for different projections.  If SCALE is defaulted (a
 "null" value or 0 is supplied), then it is determined as follows:
 a) if OUTSIZ is specified, then SCALE is computed to be that value
 which allows the data to just fit in the specified size;
 b) otherwise, SCALE is computed from the nominal FOV (0.5 mrad), by
 the formula:  SCALE = FOV * DIST, where DIST is the distance from
 spacecraft to target body at the reference time (see REFSCLK).

 For POV/PERSPECT (perspective) projection, SCALE specifies a factor
 which multiplies the default scale, which is that of the instrument
 at the distance determined by REFSCLK (or PDIST).  For this value
 of PROJ, the default value of SCALE is 1.0.

 Note that in all cases, decreasing SCALE increases the spatial size
 of the cube.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outsiz"><H3>OUTSIZ</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the linear dimensions of the spatial planes
 of the cube file:  NS and NL.

 Note that the SCALE parameter determines the size of the output mosaic,
 and therefore OUTSIZ may be omitted if SCALE is specified.  If OUTSIZ
 is defaulted, the image size will be just large enough to fit the entire
 image at the specified scale (see HELP SCALE).

 In the POV/PERSPECT case, it is allowable to specify only one of NL or NS; 
 in this case the other must be given the value 0 in OUTSIZ.  The program
 will then compute the missing value of the pair.  For other projections
 this is not allowed, i.e., the user must specify either both or
 neither of NL and NS as non-zero quantities.

 Note that if OUTSIZ is specified, the program assumes that the user has
 worked out the whole geometry, so no attempt will be made to recenter the
 image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bin"><H3>BIN</H3></A><pre>
 BIN specifies the type of binning algorithm that will be used in
 assigning output pixel values.  There are two choices, FOOTPRNT and
 NEAREST.

 BIN=NEAREST:
 This is the "nearest-neighbour" algorithm, in which the output DN is 
 assigned to the pixel closest to the map projection of the center point
 of the input pixel.  The neglect of the pixel footprint can be partially
 corrected by the FILL algorithm.

 BIN=FOOTPRNT:
 In this algorithm, the footprint in the output image is computed for
 each input pixel.  For each output pixel, the fraction of its area 
 falling inside this footprint is the weight of this pixel in the 
 determination of the final output DN.  This is accomplished by
 map-projecting the four corners of the input pixel, covering the
 resulting quadrilateral in the output image by a grid of 200 points,
 and then processing each of these points by the nearest-neighbour
 algorithm, weighted by the detector response function at that point.
 NOTE:  if the scale of the projection (or significant parts of it)
 rises to significantly more than 1 output pixel per input FOV, then
 the grid density should be correspondingly increased using the
 FPNGRID parameter.

 CAUTION:  when the footprint algorithm is used in a cylindrical
 projection (Simple/Normal Cylindrical, Mercator, Sinusoidal, Lambert),
 there is a danger that some pixels may straddle the longitude at which
 the image "wraps around", so that one side of the pixel projects at the
 far left edge of the image and the other side at the far right edge.
 This can usually be avoided by judicious choice of the position of
 the center longitude (TIELON, TIESAM), but if the data span the entire
 surface of the target body, then no choice will eliminate the possibility
 entirely.  The code contains a check for this condition for Simple
 Cylindrical, where it is easily remedied, but so far no correction has
 been implemented for the other cylindrical projecitons.

 A discussion of the weighting algorithm used when averaging output
 pixels in a given "bin" is given under HELP WTFIL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="lat_type"><H3>LAT_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
 For planets that are not modelled as perfect spheres, this keyword
 controls the type of latitudes output by the program:

 LAT_TYPE = PGRAPHIC or PDETIC (this value is provided because the term
 "planetodetic" is used for this case in VICAR documentation) specify
 planetographic latitudes, which are measured with reference to the
 surface normal.

 LAT_TYPE = PCENTRIC specifes that latitudes are planetocentric, i.e.,
 determined by the vector from the planet center.

 The default is PGRAPHIC, since this is the PDS and ISIS standard.

 The scope of this specification includes latitudes both in the cocube and
 in the label.  

 If the target body is a sphere, then this keyword is ignored and no
 reference to planetographic/-detic is made in the label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fill"><H3>FILL</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies whether or not to fill pixels for which no data
 exist by interpolation among surrounding data values.

 If requested, this algorithm requires two additional parameters, N1
 and N2, both of which are specified by the user parameter FILPAR (q.v.).

 The algorithm works as follows:  for each missing pixel (indicated by
 a data value of Null, see Help on Special Pixels) that is on-planet, 
 construct an N1 x N1 box centered on that pixel and count the number of
 valid pixels inside that box.  If this number exceeds N2, then replace
 the missing pixel  by the weighted mean of the valid pixels in the box,
 using the inverse square of the distance as the weight.

 FILL is also ignored under the TUBE option.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filpar"><H3>FILPAR</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the two parameters needed by the FILL
 algorithm (see parameter FILL): dimension of fill area, and number
 of valid pixels.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="saturatd"><H3>SATURATD</H3></A><pre>
 For a DN cube, this parameter indicates whether to flag saturated DNs,
 i.e., pixels with DN = 1023, with an ISIS special value, as described
 under "Special Pixel Values" in Help.

 For a Radiance cube, this function is done by the external calibration
 software;  in this case, this parameter indicates whether a saturated
 pixel is to be overwritten by a valid datum if it happens to coincide
 in the output cube:  IGNORE means that saturated pixels are overwitten
 by valid data, FLAG means that a saturated pixel will "dominate" any
 other coincident data, as long as its weight exceeds that specified
 by the SATTHRSH parameter.

 SATURATD=BB_REPL is a special option for radiance cubes, in which
 saturated values in the "thermal" region (which is assumed to be
 above 3.0 mu) are replaced by an estimate based on the black-body
 function for the mean brightness temperature of the non-saturated
 thermal radiances in the same comb.  This should be used with
 caution, as an experimental means of avoiding problems of varying
 contributions to a given output pixel from different parts of a
 comb due to some being saturated.

 SATURATD=MAX_REPL is an even more extravagant option, in which a
 saturated DN (1023) is replaced by the largest unsaturated value
 (1022).  This should only be used in very unusual circumstances.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="satthrsh"><H3>SATTHRSH</H3></A><pre>
Threshold weight above which to flag saturated pixels, see parameter
SATURATD.

If this is Null (which is the default), then the threshold will be
set to 0.5*S', where S' is the ratio of the actual scale to the 
nominal scale.  Typically the cube scale is set to 0.5 times nominal
(for Nyquist sampling), so this corresponds to SATTHRSH = 0.125.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="lo_sat"><H3>LO_SAT</H3></A><pre>
This parameter only has meaning if thresholding is used, in which case
DNs below a certain value are replaced by the value 4 in the EDR.  If
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#lo_sat">LO_SAT</A> is specified, then these DNs are represented in the cube by the
ISIS special value for Low_Instrument_Saturation, otherwise they are
simply replaced by NULLs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="overlap"><H3>OVERLAP</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter is used only if BIN=NEAREST.  If BIN=FOOTPRINT, then
 overapping pixels are always averaged.

 If OVERLAP = AVERAGE, then overlapping output pixels are averaged.
 This is the default option, and should only be changed for some special
 purpose.  (But see the cautions below.)

 If OVERLAP = REPLACE, then each subsequent overlapping output pixel
 replaces its predecessor, i.e., the last pixel is used.  This option
 exists for comparison of test cases with Flagstaff software.

 If OVERLAP = MAXIMUM, then in case of overlapping output pixels the
 largest one is used and others are discarded.  This is useful in case
 of boom obscuration, where the boom is darker than data pixels.

 CAUTION on the averaging process:
   Averaging uncalibrated DNs (if CALTYP=NOCAL) can give incorrect
 results if calibration constants are not the same for all data. 
 Currently, this condition is satisfied for all values except those
 in the "thermal" detectors (15, 16, and 17), which have different
 sensitivities above and below a threshold DN near 512;  the program
 corrects for this in an approximate fashion.  However, future
 calibrations may violate the condition, e.g., with dark values that
 depend on mirror position.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="thresh"><H3>THRESH</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter is used only in the Footprint option (see parameter BIN),
 and is the threshold weight above which to keep an output data value.
 If the weight for a given spatial pixel at a given grating position is
 less than THRESH, then the DNs for all 17 detectors at this point are
 set to the special value NULL (see Special Pixel Values under Help).

 The default for this parameter (if "null" is specified) is to let it
 depend on the scale of the projection relative to the nominal scale of
 the observation:  at this nominal scale, one output pixel (at least at
 the center of the projection) is equal to one input FOV;  for this, the
 default THRESH is set to 0.1.  If the scale differs from the nominal
 value, then THRESH is varied proportionally to its square.  E.g., if
 the nominal scale of an observation is 60 km/pixel, and the projection
 uses 30 km/pixel, then the default THRESH will be 0.025.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxdstor"><H3>MAXDSTOR</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter sets the maximum "distortion" allowed in the footprint
 of a single pixel, i.e., the maximum distance (in the Line or Sample
 direction) allowed between the 4 corner points of a pixel footprint.
 If this is exceeded, then the pixel is omitted from processing.

 This can be useful to remove artifacts from image regions which are
 distorted in certain map projections, e.g. the polar areas in cylindrical
 projections, and pixels falling near the limb.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fpngrid"><H3>FPNGRID</H3></A><pre>
 Determines footprint grid mesh density.  The footprint of an input pixel
 is covered by a grid with FPNGRID points in cone direction and 2*FPNGRID
 points in cross-cone.  The weight of this pixel for a given output pixel
 is then determined by counting the number of grid points falling into
 that output pixel.  (The "tent function" detector sensitivity is also
 factored into this weight.)

 Since only the four corner points of the rectangular footprint are 
 actually projected, increasing FPNGRID should not seriously degrade
 program performance, though it will have some impact.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="hbinsize"><H3>HBINSIZE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter controls the "histogram binning" option, in which output
pixels are not averaged together but are accumulated into histograms,
of which the peak value is selected as the final output.  Specifying
a non-null value for this parameter enables this option, and the value
specified is the number of bins used in each histogram.  Since there
is a histogram for each output pixel, plus one for the geometrical
weight which is still used when computing the co-cube planes, the total 
size of the weights file is NL*NS*(1+NB*(HBINSIZE+1)) real*4 items.
This is equivalent to a cube with band dimension (1+NB*(HBINSIZE+1)),
at most (NB=17, HBINSIZE=1023) 52364;  it is very doubtful that a
file anywhere near this size can actually run on our current platforms
for a typical cube, so this parameter should normally be set to a
value considerably below its maximum.

Because of the large demands on disk space, this option is only allowed
in Fixed-mode cubes.

HBINSIZE=510 (the current PDF maximum) and HBINSTEP=2 covers essentially
the entire NIMS DN range (7-1022), and works for most normal cubes.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="hbinstep"><H3>HBINSTEP</H3></A><pre>
This specifies the # of DNs per histogram bin, if the HBINSIZE parameter
is non-null.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="histcrit"><H3>HISTCRIT</H3></A><pre>
The criterion used to evaluate histogram, if the HBINSIZE parameter is 
non-null.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="slew_tol"><H3>SLEW_TOL</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the maximum slew rate allowed, in units of the Nyquist
 sampling rate of one-half NIMS resolution element (0.5 mrad) per
 grating cycle.  If two mfs in succession show a higher rate, then the
 first one is discarded. 

 The intent of this parameter is to check for scan platform flybacks
 between swaths and anomalies in the scan platform guidance and control,
 and remove these data from the observation.  Note that the first two
 minor frames after a gap (including those at the start of an observation)
 are omitted because the slew rate cannot be determined for them.  This
 can be avoided by specifying a negative number for SLEW_TOL (and
 TWISTTOL, q.v.), which suppresses the slew rate check.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="twisttol"><H3>TWISTTOL</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies the maximum twist change allowed in the AACS pointing
 data, in degrees.  If two mfs in succession show a higher rate, then the
 first one is discarded.  This parameter is similar to SLEW_TOL, in
 that it checks for "spikes" in the twist data.  (Twist angle does not
 directly affect the scan platform spaial motion, but it determines the
 NIMS mirror offset position, so a bad value can have drastic effects
 on the location of cube pixels.)

 As for parameter SLEW_TOL, this can be suppressed by specifying a
 negative number for this parameter.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cextrap"><H3>CEXTRAP</H3></A><pre>
 This keyword controls what is done when a C-matrix (pointing data) is
 missing for an mf, and when computing C-matrices for individual mirror
 positions:

   CEXTRAP (default):  if a C-matrix is missing, the program will search 
   nearby  mf's (up to a limited distance away, currently hard-coded at 10
   MFs) for valid values, and then interpolate/extrapolate to the desired mf.
   When computing C-matrices for mirror steps within an mf, if no C-matrix
   is available at both start and end of the mf, the program will extrapolate
   from the preceding mf.

   NOCEXTRP:  in both these situations, the sensor data in the mf are not
   processed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="csource"><H3>CSOURCE</H3></A><pre>
 CSOURCE specifies the source of the angles which define the camera
 pointing (characterized by the "C-matrix", which transforms between
 Earth and Camera coordinate systems).

 CSOURCE can have the following values:

   AFILE: the angles are extracted from an "AACS file", supplied by
    the NIMS team.  The name of this file must be supplied using the
    parameter AACSFILE.

   SPICE: the angles are extracted from C-kernels, specified by the
    parameters PCKERNEL and (if Debooming is desired) RCKERNEL.
    NOTE:  the RCKERNEL is not currently supported!  If de-booming is
    desired, then CSOURCE=AFILE must be specified.

 The default is AFILE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pckernel"><H3>PCKERNEL</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the C-kernel containing the scan platform pointing
 angles, to be used when CSOURCE=SPICE is specified.

 This parameter is required when CSOURCE=SPICE is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rckernel"><H3>RCKERNEL</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the C-kernel containing the rotor pointing angles,
 to be used when CSOURCE=SPICE is specified and the Deboom option is on.
 This is required in order for the program to compute the cone/clock angles
 required for the boom obscuration check.
 
 NOTE:  this is currently not supported!  If de-booming is desired, then
 an AACSFILE must be supplied, see parameter CSOURCE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="aacsfile"><H3>AACSFILE</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the name of the AACS pointing file supplied by
 the NIMS team, from which the pointing data will be obtained.

 This parameter is required when CSOURCE=AFILE is specified.

 The AACS files are online on Mipl in /project/gll/nims/aacs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="spkernel"><H3>SPKERNEL</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the SP-kernel, containing Spacecraft and
 Planet state vectors.  This parameter should not normally be specified
 by the user as the SP-kernel usage is regulated through the MIPS kernel
 database (logical name KDB__DATA).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pconstnt"><H3>PCONSTNT</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the Planet constants kernel, containing Planet
 (also Moon, Asteroid, etc.) radii and rotation constants.
 This parameter should not normally be specified by the user as the PC-
 kernel usage is regulated through the MIPS SPICE interface.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ikernel"><H3>IKERNEL</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the I-kernel (containing Instrument specs)
 that is to be read by the program.  This should not normally be
 specifed by the user.

 The NIMS I-kernels are online on Mipl at /project/gll/nims/misc.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dpoint"><H3>DPOINT</H3></A><pre>
 This specifies a single offset to Right Ascension and Declination:

  DPOINT = (dRA, dDEC)  (in RADIANS!)

 which is to be added to all the pointing data (Camera Euler angles:
 Right Ascension, Declination, Twist) read in from the source specified
 by the CSOURCE parameter.

 Note that this is the crudest possible way of correcting the pointing,
 and should only be used as a last resort.  The offset in this parameter
 would normally be derived from navigation of images pertaining to the
 observation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dpt_sclk"><H3>DPT_SCLK</H3></A><pre>
 SCLK range for DPOINT.  If (0,0) is specified (the default), then DPOINT
 applies to the entire range.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wamp"><H3>WAMP</H3></A><pre>
Amplitude of wobble that can be optionally added to the pointing.
This has the form:

  Delta(Cone) = WAMP * cos( WFREQ*t + WPHASE)
  Delta(Cross-cone) = WAMP * cos( WFREQ*t + 90 + WPHASE) * cos(CONE)
  Delta(Twist) = WAMP * cos( WFREQ*t - 90 + WPHASE) * sin(CONE)

where:
 WAMP is the amplitude in radians
 WFREQ is the frequency in degrees per minor frame (must be &gt 0)
 WPHASE = <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> with respect to the beginning SCLK of the observation,
          in degrees

Note that time, t, is measured in minor frames (MOD91) since the
beginning of the observation.

An alternative formulation in terms of Clock angle instead of time is
also supported:

  Delta(Cone) = WAMP * sin( WPHASE - CLOCK)
  Delta(Cross-cone) = - WAMP * cos( WPHASE - CLOCK) * cos(CONE)
  Delta(Twist) = - WAMP * cos( WPHASE - CLOCK) * sin(CONE)

This formulation is used when WFREQ=0 is specified.  Here WPHASE is the 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle of the wobble unit vector (cross product of the angular-
momentum unit vector and the rotor-Z axis) in the rotor coordinate system.
Since CLOCK is not available with Predict pointing, this option is only 
available when AACS telemetry pointing is supplied.  This formulation is 
more elegant than the above one since it is independent of the time of 
the observation, and takes account of clock slews.

Since CONE is required, for Predict pointing this must be specified
separately using the WCONE parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wfreq"><H3>WFREQ</H3></A><pre>
Wobble frequency, see WAMP.  The default value is the current best
estimate of the GLL Rotor frequency.

This is ignored if WAMP=0.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wphase"><H3>WPHASE</H3></A><pre>
Wobble <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A>, see WAMP.

This is ignored if WAMP=0.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wcone"><H3>WCONE</H3></A><pre>
Estimate of the Cone angle for wobble model, if Predict pointing is used.

This is ignored if WAMP=0 or an AACSFILE is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="epherr"><H3>EPHERR</H3></A><pre>
 EPHERR is a time offset (in seconds) that allows the user to simulate 
 an ephemeris error:  the time at which the spacecraft and target body
 positions are read in from the SP-kernel is offset from the time of the
 data by this amount.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mirdel"><H3>MIRDEL</H3></A><pre>
 Mirror asymmetry offset:  a signed floating-point number that is added
 to the 20 XCONE_UP mirror offsets read in from the IKERNEL and subracted
 from the 20 XCONE_DOWN offsets.

 THIS IS A TEST PARAMETER FOR USE BY THE NIMS COG.ENG. ONLY

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="goffset"><H3>GOFFSET</H3></A><pre>
 Grating offset.  This parameter is required for the calibration algorithm. 
 It helps to determine the physical grating position (GPHYS) by:
 
   GPHYS = GOFFSET + GLOG

 where GLOG is the logical g.p., obtained from the HRS data in the EDR file.

 Grating offset is expected to vary infrequently from its default of 4
 over the course of the mission.  If it does, this information must be
 supplied by the NIMS team.

 The value of this parameter is written in the cube label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="gstart"><H3>GSTART</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter allows the user to specify the grating start position,
 which is normally read in from the "digital stat" section of the HRS data.
 This is useful if the EDR is incomplete or corrupted. 

 Note that if this item is present in the EDR, then the user-specified
 value will be overwritten, unless INSMODE or NOHKP is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="gain"><H3>GAIN</H3></A><pre>
 Instrument gain state.  This parameter should not normally be specified
 by the user, as the program reads it from the LRS data in the EDR 
 record headers.  However, should this item be missing from the EDR for
 some reason, the user can supply it by this parameter.  Note that this
 quantity does not affect program processing in any way, it is included
 only for the label information.  However, the gain state should be
 consistent with the calibration file used if the cube is to be in 
 radiance units (see parameters CALTYPE and CALFILE).

 (Multiple Gain states are not supported in this parameter:  in such a
 case, the program *must* get the Gain from the EDR headers;  see
 parameter CALFILE.)

 Note that if this item is present in the EDR, then the user-specified
 value will be overwritten, unless INSMODE or NOHKP is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="chopper"><H3>CHOPPER</H3></A><pre>
 Instrument chopper mode (this has to do with the basic clock frequency).

 The numerical value signifies the following states:
   0 = 63_HERTZ mode
   1 = REFERENCE mode
   2 = OFF
   3 = FREE_RUN

 This parameter should not normally be specified by the user, as the program
 reads it from the LRS data in the EDR record headers.  However, should this
 item be missing from the EDR for some reason, the user can supply it by this
 parameter.  Note that this quantity does not affect program processing in
 any way, it is included only for the label information.  

 If this item is present in the EDR, then the user-specified value will be
 overwritten, unless INSMODE or NOHKP is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="insmode"><H3>INSMODE</H3></A><pre>
 Instrument mode.  This should not normally be specified, since it
 is determined from the Housekeeping data in the EDR file.  If the
 user should specify a mode different from what is in the data, then
 the program will immediately find a mode change and stop processing.
 Therefore, the only use for this parameter is as a check on what is
 in the EDR, or if the housekeeping data are corrupted (see param
 NOHKP).

 Codes for instrument modes are:
 0 = safe 
 1 = full map
 2 = full spect
 3 = long map
 4 = long spect
 5 = short map
 6 = short spect
 7 = fixed map
 8 = bandedge map
 9 = bandedge spect
 10 = stop/slide map
 11 = stop/slide spect
 12 = "special sequence"
 13 = "long fixed map" (see below)

 Note that stop/slide mode consists of two modes, each generating one
 cube, so that specification of the STOPSLID parameter is required.

 "Special sequence" is not an official NIMS mode, but denotes a mode
 used in Earth-2 with Short Map number of grating steps and Full Map
 grating increment.  In the future more special sequences are expected,
 in which case code must be added to handle them.

 "Long fixed map" is another unoffial mode, which was created to handle
 the I24 anomaly in which the grating was stuck.  The nominal mode of
 the observation is Long Map, and the grating delta (GDEL) is zero.  The
 number of bands in the cube is equal to the number of detectors used.

 When INSMODE is specified, parameter GSTART and, for SAFE and FIXED
 modes only, NLGP (q.v.) should also be specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nohkp"><H3>NOHKP</H3></A><pre>
 This keyword specifies that the housekeeping data in the EDR should
 be ignored.  This has two effects:  (a) the instrument mode must be
 user-specified (using parameters INSMODE, GSTART, and for some modes
 NLGP);  (b) valid data flags are ignored.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mirromit"><H3>MIRROMIT</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter instructs the program to discard the specified mirror 
 positions.  In this case (only) mirror positions are counted from 1 to
 40, i.e., the "up" and "down" scans are taken together in one cycle.
 (Usually this program considers each to be a separate scan with 20
 positions.)   Therefore, up to 39 values may be specified (it would
 be pointless to discard all 40!), and each must be in the range 1-40.

 This parameter only affects pixel DN values.  The co-tube will contain
 data for all mirror positions even if MIRROMIT has been specified. 

 This parameter is intended for test purposes and to correct problems
 with the instrument, and should not be specified by the casual user.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ins_temp"><H3>INS_TEMP</H3></A><pre>
 These are 6 instrument temperatures applying to the following subsystems,
 in order:
    Focal Plane Assembly (FPA)
    Radiation Shield
    Telescope
    Grating
    Chopper
    Electronics

 These temperatures are used by the photometric and wavelength calibration
 routines.  They are also written to the cube label.  Only the FPA and
 Grating temperatures are used in the calibration.  In <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A>-1 data, these
 temperatures are normally read from the EDR label and this parameter exits
 only to allow user override.  However in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> 2 they are not present in
 the EDR, so reasonable defaults have been added.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nlgp"><H3>NLGP</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter will very rarely be used:  it has meaning only for
 SAFE and FIXED modes (INSMODE = 0 or 7), and only if the user specifies
 INSMODE (which should itself be rare, see HELP INSMODE).

 The reason for this parameter is as follows:  in these modes, the
 grating is in fact stationary, but the mirror pretends that it is
 moving and goes into a wait state every NLGP cycles.  The program
 must know when this occurs in order to treat these data appropriately.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="stopslid"><H3>STOPSLID</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies which mode is to be used for the current cube
 if instrument mode is "Stop / Slide".  (This mode contains a mixture of
 data in 2 different modes, alternating regularly.

 NOTE:  This option is not yet implemented.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sdgeo"><H3>SDGEO</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies which band of the cocube will be used to compute
 the "geometric" standard deviation in band 8 of the cocube (see parameter
 COCUBE).  Only bands 3-7 are allowed, since the lat/long bands are not
 computed as each input pixel is processed, but once at the end of processing.

 The default is band 5, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/nimscmm2_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle.

 This parameter has no meaning under the TUBE option.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sdband"><H3>SDBAND</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies the band index at which to compute a standard
 deviation for the cocube file (see parameter COCUBE).  Band index is
 related to detector, D, and grating position, G, by:

   BAND = (D-1) * NG + G

 where D = 1,...,17
       G = 1,...,NG
       NG = number of grating positions for current instrument mode
            (possible values are 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24).

 The default for SDBAND is NB/2 (rounded up).

 This parameter has no meaning under the TUBE option.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outdets"><H3>OUTDETS</H3></A><pre>
 Range of detectors to ouput:  The two values entered are Starting
 Detector and Ending Detector, both in the range 1,...,17.

 The default (if the parameter is nulled) is to generate data for all 17
 detectors.  

 Note that the number of bands in the output cube is the number of
 detectors specified multiplied by the number of grating positions, as
 determined by the instrument mode.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="skipdet"><H3>SKIPDET</H3></A><pre>
 Detector(s) to omit.  The bands for these detector are still included in
 the cube, but all data values are set to NULL.

 Detectors are numbered from 1, so the range is 1,..,17.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nskip_gp"><H3>NSKIP_GP</H3></A><pre>
 If this is N&gt0, then only every Nth (logical) grating position will be
 processed, starting with 0.

 GPs are numbered from 0 to 23.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outband"><H3>OUTBAND</H3></A><pre>
 This parameter specifies that only a single band be generated in the
 output cube, thus making it a 2-dimensional image.  The band index will
 correspond to a certain detector, D, and grating position, G, where:

   OUTBAND = (D-1) * NG + G

 where D = 1,...,17
       G = 1,...,NG
       NG = number of grating positions for current instrument mode
            (possible values are 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24).

 By default all bands for the mode used are generated.  This parameter
 will normally only be used for test purposes.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="comp_chk"><H3>COMP_CHK</H3></A><pre>
If this keyword is set, the compression status flag is checked and EDR 
records in which it is not ok (zero) are skipped.  Otherwise, such
records are processed, though the number of possible affected combs is
reported.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="b_e_mp"><H3>B_E_MP</H3></A><pre>
 Beginning and ending mirror positions.  This should normally remain at
 the default values.  This parameter is intended for use for observations
 taken with mirror blocking, for tubes.

 By convention, mirror positions are numbered from 0 to 19, starting from
 the "top" (= most negative cross-cone value).  Hence, MP=0 corresponds
 to the rightmost pixel in a tube, sample 20.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="catalog"><H3>CATALOG</H3></A><pre>
 Specifies whether or not the program is to update the Image Catalog.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="test"><H3>TEST</H3></A><pre>
 This is a debugging/test parameter and should always be left at its
 default value of 0 by users.

 TEST=1 generates an ascii file called MTRACK.DAT, containing
  coordinates of the mirror track for the chosen projection.  

 TEST=2 generates a listing of SCLK, mirror position Lat/Long, and
  planet radius at intersect point (as returned by PPROJ).

 TEST=3 generates a listing of SCLK, OM-matrix, and RS-vector, for
  mirror extrema only.

 TEST=4 generates a listing of wavelengths and radiance scaling coefficients
  by band #.

 TEST=5 generates a listing of Euler angles, Cone, Clock (as read in from
  pointing source), and valid flag, for all mfs

 TEST=6 generates a listing of SCLK, MP, Lat, Long, Line, Sample for the
  points used to determine the map projection size and offset.

 TEST=7 is same as 5, except only valid mfs are printed

 TEST=8 is same as 2, except only data for MP=10 (counting from 1) are
  printed.

 TEST=9 generates a listing of Euler angles & Cone/X-cone offsets after
  all corrections have been applied, for MP=9 only

 TEST=10 is same as 1, except only MP=0 (mirror extrema) is printed.

 To restrict output (TEST=1-3 only) to one gp, use the OUTBAND parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="oldcal"><H3>OLDCAL</H3></A><pre>
 This keyword disables passing LRS temperatures to the calibration routines,
 so as to return the old default wavelength sets.  It also enables the old
 scheme by which the calibration routines were called at every new RIM, 
 rather than only at the start of the observation.

 It is to be used for test purposes ONLY!
