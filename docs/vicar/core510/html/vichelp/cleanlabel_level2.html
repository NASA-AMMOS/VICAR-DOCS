<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/cleanlabel.html">CLEANLABEL</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Contains the filename of the VICAR image whose label you would like to clean.  
If the image is not in your default directory, INP should contain the complete 
file specification.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Contains the filename of the VICAR image which will contain the cleaned label.
(Also see general help.)

Defaulting OUT will cause LABELCLEAN to keep the cleaned label in the input
file.

Specifying a filename for OUT has the following results:
	a) The label of the input image will remain unchanged.
	b) The output image file will contain the cleaned label and a copy of
           the input image.
	c) The file will be written to your default directory unless another
	   directory is specified.

<hr>
<A NAME="keywords"><H3>KEYWORDS</H3></A><pre>
Contains the names of the label items which are to be cleaned.  Default is to
clean all label items.  (Also see general help.)
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
Keyword indicating how the label items will be cleaned.  (Also see general 
help.)

MODE = KEEPLAST (default)
This option will cause all occurences of label items to be deleted except for 
the most recent occurence of each label item.  

MODE = KEEPFRST
This option will cause all occurences of label items to be deleted except for 
the oldest occurence of each label item.  

The next pages show an example of how each mode works.
---- Task: A --
SLAT = 0.0		For example, assume that the list on the left 
SLON = 30.5		represents an image label.
NL = 1024
NS = 1024		Cleaning this label will affect only SLAT, SLON, and 
---- Task: B --		FORMAT, since these are the only label items which
FORMAT = HALF		are duplicated.
IPL_NA = 140.		
SLAT = 46.		The next page shows the results of cleaning with
SLON = 80.		each mode.
---- Task: C --
FORMAT = HALF
FUNC = "IN1-IN2"
RESULT OF MODE = KEEPLAST	RESULT OF MODE = KEEPFRST

---- Task: A --	 		---- Task: A --
NL = 1024			SLAT = 0.0
NS = 1024			SLON = 30.5
---- Task: B --			NL = 1024
IPL_NA = 140.			NS = 1024
SLAT = 46.			---- Task: B --
SLON = 80.			FORMAT = HALF
---- Task: C --			IPL_NA = 140.
FORMAT = HALF			---- Task: C --
FUNC = "IN1-IN2"		FUNC = "IN1-IN2"
