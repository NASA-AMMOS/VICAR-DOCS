				    Specifies IBIS graphics-1 file. There
				    is no output file. Results of GF are

<A NAME="function"><H3>FUNCTION</H3></A><pre>
	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/gf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>		  this keyword specifies the function 
					to be applied,  and the coordinates  to 
					which  it applies.   Functions  are 
					delimited  by  double  quotes.    X 
					followed  by a number indicates the 
					coordinates  used as input  or  output.  
					Up  to nineteen coordinates can be used 
					as  input.   The term INDEX can  be 
					used  in the arithmetic  expression 
					to  introduce row number  into  the 
					calculation   (see  examples).    A 
					special notation is used for coordinate 
					statistics   (see  examples).    By 
					using   ","   separator,    several 
					functions can be placed in one call
					(i.e. FUNC=("X1=POLY","X2=X1*X1").
					Maximum number of coordinates in one
					execution is 50. See the help on VICAR
					program MF for more information.

<A NAME="dim"><H3>DIM</H3></A><pre>
Graphics-1 files have no dimension information stored in
the file. This parameter allows specification of the dimension.
For IBIS-1 interface and IBIS-2 format files this parameter is
ignored.

<A NAME="zeroes"><H3>ZEROES</H3></A><pre>
Graphics files use an all-zero row to indicate "pen-up", and
usually should not be treated as data. By default, GF will
SKIP these rows. To override this feature, use the 'INCLUDE
keyword.
