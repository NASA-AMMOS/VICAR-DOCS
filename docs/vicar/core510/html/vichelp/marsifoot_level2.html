<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input files contain the XYZ coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing X, Y and Z values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (X,Y,Z) order.

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output file containing the mask indicating the footprint.  Byte format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input image, it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving different (and presumably better) output coordinates.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="inst"><H3>INST</H3></A><pre>
Instrument to use.  Possible values for InSight:
        SEIS, HP3, WTS, BOTH
and for Mars 2020:
	HELI
One must be given; there is no default.  BOTH turns on both SEIS and WTS,
which simulates delta-tilt.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_body"><H3>DO_BODY</H3></A><pre>
If specified, the program will output the instrument body (aka footplane)
location, rather than the feet.  Clocking is still done, but only matters
for the HP3 (since the SEIS and WTS bodies are rotationally symmetric).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="xy"><H3>XY</H3></A><pre>
Location of footprint in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#xy">XY</A> space.  One of XY and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#ls">LS</A> must be given, but not
both.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ls"><H3>LS</H3></A><pre>
Location of footprint in line/sample space.  One of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#xy">XY</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#ls">LS</A> must be given,
but not both.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="clock_range"><H3>CLOCK_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Range of clock values to check, in the form (min,max).  Clocking is rotation
of the instrument about its axis (which is not controlled for InSight).
See MARSITILT help for details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="clock_step"><H3>CLOCK_STEP</H3></A><pre>
Step size for clocking.  Small steps give more precision, but greatly
increase execution time.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delta_wts_range"><H3>DELTA_WTS_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A>, but applies only to WTS with -BOTH.  In other words,
in -BOTH mode, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A> determines the range of the SEIS while
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#delta_wts_range">DELTA_WTS_RANGE</A> determines the range of the WTS.

If not specified, this defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delta_wts_step"><H3>DELTA_WTS_STEP</H3></A><pre>
Like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A>, but applies only to WTS with -BOTH.  In other words,
in -BOTH mode, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A> determines the step size for the SEIS while
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#delta_wts_step">DELTA_WTS_STEP</A> determines the step size for the WTS.

If not specified this defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wts_off"><H3>WTS_OFF</H3></A><pre>
There are radial and cross-radial offsets between the WTS and SEIS, because 
the grapples are not coaxial in the nominal placement.  The WTS position is 
thus offset by an amount determined in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#wts_off">WTS_OFF</A> parameter. WTS_OFF parameter
has 1 or 2 valid values. The first value defines radial offset along the 
direction back to the Lander(IDA) frame origin, and the second value defines
cross-radial offset along the direction perpendicular to radial direction. 
Radial offset defaults to 0.05 meters, and cross-radial offset defaults to 0. 
THe cross-radial offset is 0 if it is unspecified. Consider positive toward the 
Lander frame origin for radial and to the right (+Y when looking down +X) for 
cross-radial. Both radial and cross-radial offsets are applied after WTS
rotations (instrument clocking and rotations due to tether) are done. 
See the MARSITILT help for details. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_epsilon"><H3>POINT_EPSILON</H3></A><pre>
Controls how close KD tree search results have to be to the nominal point.
See the MARSITILT help for details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_name"><H3>DATA_SET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A> typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_id"><H3>DATA_SET_ID</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> is an abbreviation of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="release_id"><H3>RELEASE_ID</H3></A><pre>
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A> is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="product_id"><H3>PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_id"><H3>PRODUCER_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#producer_id">PRODUCER_ID</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="target_type"><H3>TARGET_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for the output roughness (really just determines
the unit of measurement).  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame.  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - (default) The "natural" frame for the instrument 
    (of the first input image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propagate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsifoot_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.
