<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input images. Needs to be 2 images, the left and the right images of the 
stereo pair.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output disparity image. It's a two <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#bands">bands</A> files containing the disparity
in line and sample. It has the same size as the left image scaled with the
pyramid level factor (left size / 2^(pyramid level)).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bands"><H3>BANDS</H3></A><pre>
Band index of the *left* and *right* images to process. Default is the first
band for both image. If one number is entered, that band index is applied to 
both image. If two numbers are entered, the first one applies to the first
image and the second one to the second image. If the band number is larger 
than the number of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#bands">bands</A> in the images, the last band is quietly selected.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="disp_search"><H3>DISP_SEARCH</H3></A><pre>
Which disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> strategy to use. As of now, there's only one strategy
available (STD), but eventually there could be a plane sweep approach for
instance. The standard <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> strategy (STD) is the classical approach where
a matching pixel is searched for in a 2D patch surrounding an apriori matching
location. No information on the camera model is necessary, just an image to
image comparison. The default apriori matching location assumes pre-registered
images (a given pixel (x,y) in the left image has its apriori location in the
right image at the same (x,y)). However, this assumption can be changed using
apriori external information with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#in_disp">IN_DISP</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_param">AFFINE_PARAM</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="in_disp"><H3>IN_DISP</H3></A><pre>
Prior input disparity. If a prior disparity map is available, it could be use 
by the process to reduce the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space. This is similar to the use of 
input disparities for marscor3, which needs a starting point. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#in_disp">IN_DISP</A> must
be a 2-band file (line, sample disparities). For each pixel, the process will 
center the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space at the location pointed at by the input disparities.
The input disparity file does not need to be the size of the input images, but
should have the same line/sample ratio. Input disparity files should not contain
non valid values (NaN, Inf).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="affine_param"><H3>AFFINE_PARAM</H3></A><pre>
To supply a prior mapping between left and right image, which allow the 
reduction of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space. It's a 6-parameter field (a, b, c, d, e, f):
Xright = a * Xleft + b * Yleft + c 
Yright = d * Xleft + e * Yleft + f
For convenience, a 2-parameters entry is also allowed which correspond to a
global shift (c, f). 
For each pixel, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space will be centered at the affine-transformed 
location in the right image.

VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_size">AFFINE_SIZE</A>
Not used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_param">AFFINE_PARAM</A> is not used.
This parameter is to supply the size of the image corresponding to the 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_param">AFFINE_PARAM</A> values. If not supplied, the default is to assume that the
values are expressed w.r.t. the left image size. If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_param">AFFINE_PARAM</A> values
are expressed in a downsampled version of the left image for instance, then the
X,Y size of that downsampled image must be entered here. The altenative if for 
the user to convert the values to the Left image size and supply these. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_img"><H3>MATCH_IMG</H3></A><pre>
Select the core matching algorithm. There are currently two options:
NCC: The Normalized Cross-Correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient). This 
approach is insensitive to affine constrast change.
ZSSD: The Zero-mean Sum of Square Difference. Faster than NCC but insensitive 
to additive contrast change only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="template"><H3>TEMPLATE</H3></A><pre>
Size of the correlation window in pixels. Default : 7. 
Tuning this parameter is an art. Typically, larger values give smooth maps at 
coarse resolution and not very sensitive to small objects. Small values give 
finer resolution of disparity maps, but may not converge on some pixels. 
Correlation window can be rectangular using two parameters (line, sample), but
each side must be odd

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="search"><H3>SEARCH</H3></A><pre>
Define the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> area of the correlation between the left patch and the right 
patch. It represents the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> distance on one side of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">template</A>. So, for
instance, if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A>=2, then the search area is 2 pixels to the left, to the
right, up and down. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> can be different in X and Y using tow parameters
(line, samp), but can't be different in one direction (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> to the left and
to the right is the same. Same thing with up and down). Default is 3.
A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">TEMPLATE</A> of 7x7 and a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> of 3 will result in a total search box of
(7+2*3)x(7+2*3) pixels. 
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> inputs are always set w.r.t. the full size input image, irrespective
of a pyramidal approach (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#run_pyr">RUN_PYR</A>) or a final pyramid level (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#pyrlevel">PYRLEVEL</A>). The
process will adjust <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> based on which pyramid level is computed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="subpixel"><H3>SUBPIXEL</H3></A><pre>
This adjust how much <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> precision is needed. Default is 0, which means
no <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> measurement. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> = 0 means no subpixel precision
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> = 1 means 1/2 pixel precision
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> = 2 means 1/3 pixel precision
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> = 3 means 1/4 pixel precision
etc...
Similarly to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">TEMPLATE</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A>, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> precision can be different
in X and Y (line, samp).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="regularization"><H3>REGULARIZATION</H3></A><pre>
Select which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> scheme to use:
- NOREG: No <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>. This is euivalent to a standard matching approach
where the best matching score is selected.
- SGM: Standard Semi-Global Matching. 
- MGM: More Global Matching. 
The number of regualrization <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> for SGM and MGM is selected with 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">DIRECTIONS</A> (either 4 or 8).
See comment above for further details on SGM and MGM. MGM is slightly more time
consuming than SGM but produces disparity map with reduced striking artefact.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="directions:"><H3>DIRECTIONS:</H3></A><pre>
Either 4 or 8. Default is 8.
The number of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> to use with SGM or MGM. If no 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> is selected, this parameter has no effect.
4: Four <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>: 2 along the line, from left to right and
from right to left. 2 along the sample, going up and going down.
8: Eight <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>: the 4 above plus 2 along the diagonal
going top/left to bottom right and vice-vers, and 2 along the other diagonal 
going from top right to bottom left, and vice versa.
8 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> takes longer to process, but provide better constraints to the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="reg_params"><H3>REG_PARAMS</H3></A><pre>
Supply the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameters. These are mandatory if using SGM or
MGM and don't have any default values. Use <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">AUTOCORRELATION</A> to get an 
estimate of the parameters to get started.
Depending on the disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> approach used (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#disp_search">DISP_SEARCH</A>), different 
sets of parameters can be expected. As of now, only one disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> mode
is available.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#disp_search">DISP_SEARCH</A>=STD:
This is the standard 2D <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> approach. See description above for detailed
explanation The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameters number are either 2 (P1, P2) or 4 
if using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> accuracy (P1 P2 P1subpixel P2subpixel).

<A NAME="autocorrelation"><H3>AUTOCORRELATION</H3></A><pre>
Generally speaking, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> is the correlation of a signal with a 
shifted version of itself. In our context, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> is the matching
score of a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">template</A> with the same template shifted by 1 or 2 pixels. It
gives an idea of the change in matching score when the correct matching 
location is 1 or 2 pixels away, which is a good estimate of what the 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> score should be. 
If set, the process will run the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> on the left image, for
all the pixel, and compute the average correlation score obtained by shifting
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">template</A> by 1 and 2 pixels, which would give the estimate for P1 and P2.
Only a shift in the X direction is done, we assume the results would be
approximately the same in the Y direction. When <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> is requested, the same
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> process is carried <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A> on the left image and a shifted (by
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> step) version of itself. The resulting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> score are
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A> on the console and the process exits without running. The process 
should be run again, this time removing the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">AUTOCORRELATION</A> parameter and adding
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#reg_params">REG_PARAMS</A> values.
If a call to marsrcorr is done without <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">AUTOCORRELATION</A> and without 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#reg_params">REG_PARAMS</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">AUTOCORRELATION</A> is by automatically turned on.

<hr>
<A NAME="filter"><H3>FILTER</H3></A><pre>
Activate a pre-processing gaussian low-pass <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter">filter</A> applied to both input
images. This is useful to reduce the noise of the input images.
Note that this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter">filter</A> is not necessary if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#pyrlevel">PYRLEVEL</A> &gt 0, as the images are
automatically filtered before downsampling.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter_size."><H3>FILTER_SIZE.</H3></A><pre>
Scales the intensity of the gaussian low-pass filtering.
If 1 or less, no filtering.
The value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A> corresponds approximately to the low pass filtering
that should be done to subsample the image with a factor of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A>. For
instance, if set to 2, this corresponds to the low pass filtering that would 
be done if we were to reduce the resolution by a factor of 2. 
In the case for instance of MSL mastcam images (x3 difference resolution between
left and right - right being higher resolution), a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A> of (1,3) should 
be used. Or if one wants to also denoise a little the first image (the second
image is automatically denoised due to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A>=3), then (1.1, 3) could 
be used. If left and right images have the same resolution, and only a small low
pass filtering is needed to denoise, then a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A> of 1.1 to 1.4 depending
on the noise level. 
No effect if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A> is off.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter_const"><H3>FILTER_CONST</H3></A><pre>
When <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A> is on, the images are low pass filtered with a Gaussian kernel. The
kernel support is sized to 3-sigmas and the sigma value is defined from 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A>. However, FILTER_SIZE value is not equal to sigma. The latter 
is derived from the former using this relation, which is generally accepted in
the litterature:
sigma = Cst * SQRT(<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">filter_size</A> ^2 -1) with Cst ~0.5 - 0.8
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_const">FILTER_CONST</A> controls this Cst. Default is 0.6.
As one can see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_const">FILTER_CONST</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A> are related, so the overall low
pass filtering can be tuned with both. However, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_size">FILTER_SIZE</A> should be used
primarily, with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter_const">FILTER_CONST</A> being rarely changed. It's actually a parameter
mostly to avoid having a hard-coded value in the code. 
No effect if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#filter">FILTER</A> is off.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="pyrlevel"><H3>PYRLEVEL</H3></A><pre>
Pyramid level of the output disparity. Default is 0. 0 is full resolution, 1 is 
half resolution in each dimension, 2 is quarter, etc.  
Pyramid level drastically reduces processing times as the number of pixels
in the left image to match reduces, but also the length of the epipolar curves
in the right image reduces.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="run_pyr"><H3>RUN_PYR</H3></A><pre>
This parameter activates a pyramidal approach. This is mainly useful to speed
up the process, although experience shows that it also help the general quality
of the correlation resutl. When activated, the images are downsampled to a 
critical size (controlled by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#max_pyr_size">MAX_PYR_SIZE</A>). Then the images are correlated at 
that size on full <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> range and/or ranges defined from a prior (IN_MESH,
IN_RANGE). Results are passed on to the next level where the images are one size
up and the range bracket is narrowed down around the range found in the previous 
scale. This is reiterated until the final pyramid level of the output 
correlation. Either full resolution or level given by PYR_LEVEL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_pyr_size"><H3>MAX_PYR_SIZE</H3></A><pre>
This parameters controls the minimum size of the images allowable by the 
pyramidal approach. This parameter is only relevant if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#run_pyr">RUN_PYR</A> is used.
When pyramical approach is used, the input images are downsampled by a 
factor of 2, 4, 8, etc.. until one side (col or row) or either the Left or Right
image is smaller than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#max_pyr_size">MAX_PYR_SIZE</A>. When the side size is less than MAX_PYR_SIZE
then the downsampling stops and the correlation process begins.




<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered output.
 
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

CAHV_FOV: All Missions using CAHV-based camera models.  Valid values are:
* MIN or INTERSECT:    Aligning stereo-pair cameras produces virtual camera 
                       with FOV equal to INTERSECTION area of two input 
	               cameras. (default) As a result, the output image is 
                       missing,sometimes a significant, (depending on camera 
                       geometry) part of overlap area between two cameras but 
                       there are no black areas on the side.  The image data
	               is stretched in horizontal direction.

* MAX or UNION:        Aligning stereo-pair cameras produces virtual camera 
                       with FOV equal to UNION area of two input cameras.
         	       The result is the opposite of the MIN option: 
                       wide black areas on the side, but the stereo-pair's 
	               intersection area is preserved.  The image data
	               is squeezed in horizontal direction.

Note that the above two entries have two names each, which are equivalent
and it's up to the user to decide which one is more intuitive to him/her.

* LINEAR:              Uses only CAHV vectors and ignores higher order terms 
                       OR(E) while aligning the cameras.  As a result, this
                       mode has advantage of best preserving horizontal
	               aspect ratio.  The features in the image look
                       similar, scale-wise, to the original.

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS
"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf
The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for the output camera model.  Also the coordinate
system used for the actual ray tracing.  Note that the surface model parameters
are always expressed in the Fixed site, however.

The interpretation of the values is dependent on the mission.  Some
representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
