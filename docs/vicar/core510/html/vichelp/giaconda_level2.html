<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/giaconda.html">GIACONDA</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
INP = (input-1,...,input-n), where the inputs are up to eight input image
filenames of registered, FICOR'ed, and VGRFIX'ed images.  The images must have
been taken with different filters and must all be the same size. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
[OUT = (red-output,green-output,blue-output)], where the -output's are image 
filenames to be used as inputs to the display device.  If none is specified, 
the program will only compute and display the transformation matrix.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="colors"><H3>COLORS</H3></A><pre>
COLORS = (color-1,...,color-n), where the colors are up to 10 names of special 
colors defined by the program LEONARDO.  There must be at least as may colors 
named as their are input images, and none of the colors may be a linear 
combination of the others.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scfname"><H3>SCFNAME</H3></A><pre>
SCFNAME = (input-1), the special colors input file must be specified from
which GIACONDA reads the special colors. The file is a 100-line by 70-sample 
VICAR image file.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="weights"><H3>WEIGHTS</H3></A><pre>
[WEIGHTS=(weight-1,...,weight-n)], where each weight corresponds to a special 
color (as they are ordered in the COLORS specification).  These weights are 
used in the least-squares-fit solution and specify the recipricol of the 
square of sigma.  The number of weights specified must be at most equal to the 
number of colors specified.  If fewer are specified, the remainder of them 
will be set to 1.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
[SCALE = max-dn], where max-dn is the maximum input dn that will not be 
saturated on the output.  The default is 10000 (normally corresponding to I/F 
= 1).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="device"><H3>DEVICE</H3></A><pre>
[DEVICE = image-device], where image-device specifies the device on which the 
output image files are to be displayed.  The only valid device at this time is 
the default, 'TV (Conrac 7211). 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="devmat"><H3>DEVMAT</H3></A><pre>
[DEVMAT = user-device-matrix], where user-device-matrix is used to convert 
chomaticity cooridinates to devise inputs.  The default value is the matrix
generated by the program based on the parameter DEVICE.  The order of entry is

  	rx, ry, rz, gx, gy, gz, bx, by, bz,

where, for example, rx is the x coefficient in the linear equation for the
red device input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="devoff"><H3>DEVOFF</H3></A><pre>
[DEVOFF = user-device-offset], where user-device-offset is a vector which is
added to device inputs.  This parameter is ignored if DEVMAT is not entered.
Its default is (0,0,0).  The order of entry is

  	r, g, b,

where, for example, r is the constant coefficient in the linear equation for
the red device input.
