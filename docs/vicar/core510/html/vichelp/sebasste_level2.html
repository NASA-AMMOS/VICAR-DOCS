<pre>
The input file should be a 128 band SEBASS file of radiance data (preferably
ground radiance).  The units should be milliWatts per square meter per
steradian par micrometer, which are the units output by the program SEBASSCAL.

The first output will be the emissivity image.  It will be a 128 channel file
of halfword data.  The pixels are scaled by a factor of 10,000.  That is, an
emissivity of 1.0 is given the value 10000; an emissivity of 0.915 becomes
9150, etc.
The second output will be the kinetic temperature image.  It will be a single
channel file of halfword data.  The pixels will be in units of degrees 
Celsius scaled by a factor of 100.  That is, a temperature of 9.87 deg C
is given the value 987; a temperature of -15.35 becomes -1535.

SEBASSTE calculates temperature and emissivity in the following manner: 
First, the brightness temperature for each of the 128 channels of the pixel
is calculated. These 128 temperatures are sorted from high to low and the
channel of the KEY'th highest temperature is assigned an emissivity of the
value of EMIS.  Using this emissivity, the kinetic temperature is calculated.
Using this kinetic temperature, the emissivities of the remaining channels
are calculated.
     Therefore, KEY represents the number of channels that pierce the
greybody curve envelope that is draped over the radiance spectrum. Noise
free input should be run with KEY=1, and the value of KEY should be raised
as the amount of overall noise or number of noisy channels increases.

are calculated.
     Therefore, EMIS represents the expected peak of the emissivity in the
pixel's true (noise free) spectrum.  The output spectrum will in fact have
KEY-1 spectral emissivities higher than EMIS, but these are regarded as
high due to noise.

<A NAME="date"><H3>DATE</H3></A><pre>
This is the date the data were acquired, in the format yyyymmdd (e.g.
19970922 for September 22, 1997).  It is used to determine which
wavelength calibration to use.
