<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt.html">MARSITILT</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input files contain the XYZ coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing X, Y and Z values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (X,Y,Z) order.

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output file containing the tilt values.  Three bands, float format:

Band 1: State band (contains goodness flag)
Band 2: Minimum tilt or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A> tilt
Band 3: Maximum tilt or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A> tilt

See "Output File Format" in the main help for more details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uix_out"><H3>UIX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Optional output file containing the normal of the instrument (at the middle
of the clock range) if the instrument was placed at this pixel.  It is a
3-band output in float format, containing a unit vector (very similar to
UVW surface normal files).  See the main help for further description.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zix_out"><H3>ZIX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Optional output file containing the Z level of the instrument (at the middle
of the clock range) if the instrument was placed at this pixel.  It is a
1-band output in float format.  See the main help for further description.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="upx_out"><H3>UPX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Optional output file containing the normal of the instrument (at the middle
of the clock range) if the instrument was placed at this pixel. It is similar 
to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#uix_out">UIX_OUT</A> except that it is generally measured in Lander frame instead of Site
frame. The coordinate system can be defined using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#p_coord">P_COORD</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="xpx_out"><H3>XPX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Optional output file containing XYZ coordinates of the instrument (at the middle
of the clock range). It is similar to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#zix_out">ZIX_OUT</A> except that it is generally 
measured in Lander frame and it contains all XYZ coordinates. The coordinate
system can be defined using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#p_coord">P_COORD</A>.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="p_coord"><H3>P_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Coordinate system used for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#upx_out">UPX_OUT</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#xpx_out">XPX_OUT</A> parameters. If not given, it 
defaults to Lander (Rover) frame. This parameter is ignored unless either 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#upx_out">UPX_OUT</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#xpx_out">XPX_OUT</A> is specified.  

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input image, it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving different (and presumably better) output coordinates.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="inst"><H3>INST</H3></A><pre>
Instrument to use.  Possible values for InSight:
        SEIS, HP3, WTS, BOTH
and for Mars 2020:
        HELI
One must be given; there is no default.  For <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A>-tilt, this must be SEIS.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delta"><H3>DELTA</H3></A><pre>
Keyword that selects standard or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A> tilt.  Delta tilt computes the
difference in tilt between SEIS and WTS.  See the main help for algorithm
details.  The default is standard tilt.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tilt_threshold"><H3>TILT_THRESHOLD</H3></A><pre>
Maximum allowed tilt.  If the maximum tilt goes beyond this threshold,
the status band will change to 3 (execeds threshold).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sinkage"><H3>SINKAGE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies how much each foot can sink into the ground.  See the main help
for detailed algorithm.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="clock_range"><H3>CLOCK_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Range of clock values to check, in the form (min,max).  Clocking is rotation
of the instrument about its axis (which is not controlled for InSight).
See the main help for details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="clock_step"><H3>CLOCK_STEP</H3></A><pre>
Step size for clocking.  Small steps give more precision, but greatly
increase execution time.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delta_wts_range"><H3>DELTA_WTS_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A>, but applies only to WTS with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A> tilt.  In other words,
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A>-tilt mode, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A> determines the range of the SEIS while
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta_wts_range">DELTA_WTS_RANGE</A> determines the range of the WTS.

If not specified, this defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_range">CLOCK_RANGE</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="delta_wts_step"><H3>DELTA_WTS_STEP</H3></A><pre>
Like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A>, but applies only to WTS with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A> tilt.  In other words,
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta">delta</A>-tilt mode, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A> determines the step size for the SEIS while
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#delta_wts_step">DELTA_WTS_STEP</A> determines the step size for the WTS.

If not specified this defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#clock_step">CLOCK_STEP</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wts_off"><H3>WTS_OFF</H3></A><pre>
There are radial and cross-radial offsets between the WTS and SEIS, because
the grapples are not coaxial in the nominal placement.  The WTS position is
thus offset by an amount determined in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#wts_off">WTS_OFF</A> parameter. WTS_OFF parameter
has 1 or 2 valid values. The first value defines radial offset along the
direction back to the Lander(IDA) frame origin, and the second value defines
cross-radial offset along the direction perpendicular to radial direction.
Radial offset defaults to 0.05 meters, and cross-radial offset defaults to 0.
The cross-radial offset is 0 if it is unspecified. Consider positive toward the
Lander frame origin for radial and to the right (+Y when looking down +X) for
cross-radial. Both radial and cross-radial offsets are applied after WTS
rotations (instrument clocking and rotations due to tether) are done. 
See the MARSITILT help for details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="leaf_max_size"><H3>LEAF_MAX_SIZE</H3></A><pre>
Controls the leaf size for the KD tree used for searching for foot locations.
See the main help for details.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_epsilon"><H3>POINT_EPSILON</H3></A><pre>
Controls how close KD tree search results have to be to the nominal point.
See the main help for details.

Some notes on how the default was computed follow.  The MSL navcam is 0.82
mrad/pixel; InSight IDC should be about the same.  None of the workspace is
more than 4m away.  So the pixel size at extreme range is:
	4*tan(.00082) = .00328m

So if we don't find a point within 4mm of where we're looking, we don't
have a point (e.g. there's a hole at that location).  Close in, say 1.2m range:
	1.2*tan(.00082) = .000984m
Call it 1mm.  So with a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#point_epsilon">point_epsilon</A> of .004 we tolerate gaps of up to 4
pixels in the near field.


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="foot_window"><H3>FOOT_WINDOW</H3></A><pre>
Window size for foot search (see main help).  This is actually the half size
(distance on either side of center).  Default is calculated as follows.
At 1.2m, the IDC pixel size is .984mm (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#point_epsilon">POINT_EPSILON</A> help).  For a 5cm
radius foot (HP3, the largest), the number of pixels is .05/.000984 = 50.8130
pixels.  Call it 75 for margin (to avoid clipping too soon).  Farther <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#out">out</A> is
smaller, so clipping is not a danger.

It may be advantageous to adjust the foot window for ortho mosaics to reflect
the actual pixel scale (size in pixels of a 5cm patch, plus some margin).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bad_tilt"><H3>BAD_TILT</H3></A><pre>
Value to use in the min/max tilt bands to indicate an invalid (unknown) tilt.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter_scale"><H3>FILTER_SCALE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is used to control the outlier filter.  Points with a Z
excursion from the average larger than filter*sigma (where sigma is the
standard deviation of all points within the patch being considered) will
be discarded.  This helps to eliminate spikes and noise hits in the XYZ
data.  However, too small a value could make it miss small rocks.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing.  The default is on.  The main help
describes some environment variables that can further control parallel
processing.  Note that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built in
to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP
documentation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_name"><H3>DATA_SET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A> typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_id"><H3>DATA_SET_ID</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> is an abbreviation of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="release_id"><H3>RELEASE_ID</H3></A><pre>
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A> is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="product_id"><H3>PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_id"><H3>PRODUCER_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#producer_id">PRODUCER_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_inst"><H3>PRODUCER_INST</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="target_name"><H3>TARGET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satellite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="target_type"><H3>TARGET_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for the output roughness (really just determines
the unit of measurement).  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame.  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - (default) The "natural" frame for the instrument 
    (of the first input image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propagate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/marsitilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.
