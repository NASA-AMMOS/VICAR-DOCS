PURPOSE:
Perform plane fitting to a set of mesh vertices. See method section for more 
details. The input is a mesh. The output is a file containing the 3D average 
vertex position and the 3D plane normal vector.

EXECUTION:

   OBJ2PLANE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=mesh.obj <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=params.txt <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#decimation">DECIMATION</A>=integer_value <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#algo">ALGO</A>=string

METHOD:

The mesh vertices are first read using TINY_OBJLOADER and averaged. 
Additionally, the plane parameters are computed.

A plane is generally described by a normal vector n = [a, b, c]^T and a distance
d, such that for point p = [x, y, z]^T on the plane n dot p + d = 0. We can 
write this as:
	ax + by + cz + d = 0

Given the (x,y,z) positions of each vertex, a linear system of the form "AX=0" 
can be set up, where the matrix A is composed of each vertex (x,y,z) per row 
minus the centroid, and X = (a,b,c,d). The solution corresponds to the singular 
vector corresponding to the least singular value from the Singular Value 
Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix A, which is performed using the Eigen 
Library. If A is decomposed as U*S*V^T, this vector typically corresponds to the
right-most column of the matrix V, where the S maatrix contains the singular 
values of A along its diagonal. This solution does not make any assumptions 
about the input data, but can be slower for large meshes. It minimizes the 
"geometric fit", or orthogonal distance from points to the plane.

A simplified solution is to assume that z = f(x,y), which is accurate for 
certain planar meshes but is not as robust to different types of terrain as the 
SVD-based method. In this case, the system can be written as follows:
	ax + by + c = z

Given N data points (x[i], y[i], z[i]), the 3x3 symmetric matrix A is formed:

	sum_i x[i]*x[i],    sum_i x[i]*y[i],    sum_i x[i]
	sum_i x[i]*y[i],    sum_i y[i]*y[i],    sum_i y[i]
	sum_i x[i],         sum_i y[i],         N

Also compute the 3-element right-hand side vector b:
	(sum_i x[i]*z[i],   sum_i y[i]*z[i],    sum_i z[i])^T

Finally, the system "Ax = b" is solved, and the three components of the solution 
vector are the coefficients to the least-square fit plane {a,b,c}. 

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#decimation">DECIMATION</A> parameter controls how many mesh vertices are used as part of the
linear system. A value of '1' indicates that all available vertices should be 
used, while '10' is used to take every tenth value, etc.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core510/html/vichelp/obj2plane_level2.html#algo">ALGO</A> parameter defines whether the faster regression-based method, 
"regression", or the slower but more accurate SVD-based method, "svd", should 
be used.
