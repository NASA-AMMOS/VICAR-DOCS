PURPOSE:

This program is used to transform an image through a disparity map so the
geometry matches that of the partner.  For example, transforming a right-eye
image so it coregisteres with the left eye, using a left-to-right disparity
map.

This can be used to create a multiple-eye coregistered all-filter data set,
to coregister across camera instruments, or as a quality check for correlation
programs such as marsjplstereo and marscor3.

It uses the disparity map to transform the non-reference image (usually the
right image) so it matches the reference (usually the left) image.  For
simplicity, the reference image is called left here; the other is called right.
In reality, the program will work either direction (e.g. mapping the left image
to the right geometry, using an R-&gtL disparity map).

When using this as a quality control, if the correlation succeeded, the
resulting image (derived from the right) should exactly match the left image,
modulo differences in intensity (or filters) between the images.  In practice
of course, this is impossible; some differences remain.  The amount of these
differences provides an indication as to the quality of the correlation.

EXECUTION:

marsjplstereo <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=(left,right) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#out">out</A>=dispar.1d

marsdispwarp <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=(right left) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#out">out</A>=right_warp_to_left.2d <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=dispar.2d

Note that the inputs are given in (R L) order, which is backwards from how
the disparity was run.  Note also that the disparity input to marsdispwarp
must be a single two-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#band">band</A> file.  Separate one-band files (which are legal
outputs of the correlators) are not accepted.

The program can also handle pyramid (downsampled) disparity maps:

marsjplstereo (left,right) dispar.1d pyramid=1
marsdispwarp (right left) right_warp_to_left.2d dispar.1d disp_pyr=1

as well as image pairs that have differential <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> (see the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#ref_not_zoomed">REF_NOT_ZOOMED</A>
parameter).

The first input ("right") is the image being transformed; the pixel data
comes from here.  The second input ("left") is optional but is used to set
the label of the output.

OPERATION:

The process works by looping over the disparity map.  For each pixel, the
value of the disparity map is retrieved.  This represents the location of
the corresponding pixel in the right image.  Optionally, bilinear interpolation
is performed on the disparity map (i.e. on the *coordinates* of the pixel);
this allows the output to be larger than the disparity map.  Then the pixel
itself is retrieved (again using bilinear interpolation) from the right image
and placed in the output image.  Interpolation can be turned off if it is not
appropriate, such as when warping an XYZ image.

Note that the left *image* is not used, but the label is used as the source
of the camera model for the output image label.  The left image is thus
optional, if a camera model is not required.  The results should match the
geometry of the left image (ignoring the effects of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>).

See the documentation for the correlation programs for the format of the
disparity map files.

The output label will match the first ("right") input, except that the camera
model has been replaced with the model from the second ("left") input.  This
means the camera model correctly describes the geometry of the image (it is
adjusted for all zooms).  However, because the image is still labeled as a
"right" image, kinematics will no longer work (it would give you a right-eye
model, when a left-eye model is needed here).  Relabeling it as "left" would
lose the information that this was once a right-eye image, which can be
important e.g. for filters.  Thus, future uses of this image in the mars*
program suite will need the point=cm=label parameter.

If the second ("left") input is not given, the camera model will be copied
from the disparity map.  This is okay as long as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">disp_pyramid</A> is 0 (and
disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> is 1) but will result in an incorrect model if it is not.

Zooming and Line/Sample Coordinates
-----------------------------------

The program supports a number of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> and pyramid modes.  Together these
greatly increase the use cases for the program.

There are actually five different line/sample coordinates involved here.

1) Line/sample coordinates in the reference (left) image.
2) Line/sample coordinates in the disparity file.  Normally these match #1
but they can differ in some cases.
3) Line/sample coordinates in the non-reference (right) image, where the
pixels come from.
4) Line/sample coordinates which are the *values* (DN's) in the disparity file.
Normally the same as #3 but can differ in some cases.
5) Line/sample coordinates in the output image.  Normally the same as #1 but
can differ in some cases.

In the most normal case, 1, 2, and 5 all match, and 3 matches 4.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">ZOOM</A> parameter modifies the relationship between output coordinates (#5)
and the input geometry (#1/2).  A given <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor will cause the output
size to be increased (or shrunk) by that amount.  So <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=2 will double the
output size, while <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=0.5 will halve it.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A> parameters modify the relationship between
disparity coordinates (#2 and #4) and their corresponding image files (#1 and
#3, and by implication #5).  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> works exactly the same as
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> for marscor3 or other programs.  It says that the disparity file
is a certain power of 2 smaller than it should "naturally" be.  So if the input
images are 1024x1024, a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A> of 3 says the disparity map should be
128x128 (2^3=8; 1024/8=128), and the values in the disparity map should
likewise be in the range 1-128.  The output size will be 1024x1024 (in the
absence of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">ZOOM</A>).

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A> has the same effect as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A>, except it is not constrained
to an integer power of two.  So a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A> of 3 or 0.5 are legal.  Note that
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">DISP_ZOOM</A> is applied to the pyramid level, so DISP_PYR=3 DISP_ZOOM=1.5 means
a final disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of 12 (2^3 * 1.5).

Finally, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#ref_not_zoomed">REF_NOT_ZOOMED</A> parameter changes the relationship between
the disparity line/sample coordinates (#2) and the reference image coordinates
(#1).  It says that the reference image is *not* zoomed by the disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>.
In other words, coordinates #2 match #1, even though the disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> says
otherwise.  This allows the output of disparity (#4) to be zoomed differently
from the input (#2).

In all cases, the output image's camera model will be correct if a reference
image is supplied as the second input.  If the second input is not given, the
camera model will be correct only if there is no disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>.

Use Cases
---------

NOTE: point=cm=label should be added to all these command lines in this
section; it has been omitted for simplicity.

Some use cases may help clarify.  First the simple case, a stereo pair of
Navcams.  Coregistering the data with the full-res disparity map is simple:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( NR.vic NL.vic \) NL_geom_NR_data.vic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=NL_to_NR.dsp

If you want to use the first-stage correlator output instead, use <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_pyramid">DISP_PYRAMID</A>
to set the disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( NR.vic NL.vic \) NL_geom_NR_data.vic
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=NL_to_NR_dff.vic disp_pyr=2

Now for a more complex example.  Let's say you have three MSL images at
very different image scales: Navcam, Mastcam-L, and Mastcam-R.  Each are
a factor of 3 (approximately) higher resolution than the previous.  Disparity
maps have been created by correlating N&lt-&gtML and ML<->MR.

Creating an image of ML data coregistered to MR is simple:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( ML.vic MR.vic \) MR_geom_ML_data.vic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=MR_to_ML.dsp

The inverse (MR data coregistered to ML) is equally simple:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( MR.vic ML.vic \) ML_geom_MR_data.vic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=ML_to_MR.dsp

However, this data is at the ML resolution - the MR detail is lost.  To get
data in the ML geometry but preserving the MR detail requires the output
be zoomed (by a factor of 3 in this case):

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( MR.vic ML.vic \) ML_geom_MR_data_big.vic
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=ML_to_MR.dsp <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=3

The same applies to making a ML at Nav resolution:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( ML.vic NAV.vic \) NAV_geom_ML_data_big.vic
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=NAV_to_ML.dsp <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=3

But now let's say we want to get the MR data coregistered to the Navcam.
Because we don't have a Nav to MR correlation directly, we have to chain the
results together.  We already have the MR at ML resolution, so that can be
used as the input to marsdispwarp.  However, the ML_geom_MR_data_big.vic file
is 3x the size of the ML itself.  That means the NAV_to_ML.dsp disparity file
effectively has a disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of 3 - the values (coordinate #4) are 3x
smaller than the actual file (coordinate #3).  But, the NAV_to_ML.dsp file
is properly coregistered to the Navcam input already - there is no difference
between coordinates #2 and #1.  This is handled by using the -REF_NO_ZOOM
parameter:

$MARSLIB/marsdispwarp \( ML_geom_MR_data_big.vic NAV.vic \)
    NAV_geom_MR_data_big.vic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp">disp</A>=NAV_to_ML.dsp <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#disp_zoom">disp_zoom</A>=3 -ref <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=3

The last <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>=3 preserves the MR resolution in the output.  The final result
(assuming 1024x1024 navcams) is 9x that size: 9216x9216, but it coregisters
the MR with the NAV without sacrificing resolution.

Note that in these cases, a simple <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of the reference image (using e.g.
$R2LIB/size) is needed to make the reference as big as the output.  This is
fine for imagery but loses the camera model.  Another option is to not <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/marsdispwarp_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A>
the reference image but rather use the mosaic programs to create a common
output image.  As long as the camera models are correct, the different zooms
will be handled properly.
