<pre>
There are two input files minimum.
File#1: This is the left or first input image given to
        program TRACKER. Vectors will be grawn upon this
        image with the base at the correct location.
File#2: This is the MARK file written by program TRACKER.
        It is 'REAL' format with 512 byte records containing
        pairs of tiepoints in the order:
        left_line,left_samp,right_line,right_samp.
Files 3 to 101 are optional mark files forming a chain vector end to
        end.  
NOTE: all mark files must be the same size and length.

<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
This is the output image. It is a copy of input #1 (in that 
format) with superimposed vectors contained in the MARK file.
Vectors are drawn from left_line,left_samp  to
right_line,right_samp.

<A NAME="exag"><H3>EXAG</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#exag">Exag</A> is a real number which exaggerates the vector length.
Default is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#exag">exag</A>=1.0

<hr>
<A NAME="dn"><H3>DN</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#dn">DN</A> is an integer which sets the DN intensity value of the
vectors. Default is n=255
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#dn">DN</A> is negative then:
1. Vectors are drawn on an image of zero <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#dn">dn</A>.
2. Vectors are written from 1 to 255 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/dvector_level2.html#dn">dn</A> representing angles from 0
   to 360 degrees.
3. No X is drawn at the vector base.
