Keyword for the operation to perform:
'APPEND  Appends graphics files.  All of the input files are assumed
           to have dimension of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/grutil_level2.html#dim">DIM</A>.  Output file has same dimension.

'SWAP    Swaps first two coordinates of each set (e.g. x-y to y-x).

'3DTO2D  Converts a 3D file whose third coordinate is a file or level 
           number to multiple 2D files.  The file number of a line string
           is the integer part of the third coordinate in the first set.
           Linestrings whose file number is outside the range (one to
           the number of output files) are not output.
           
'2DTO3D  Converts multiple 2D files to one 3D file with the third 
           coordinate containing the file number.  The third coordinate
           in each set (except the zero terminator) contains the file
           number (i.e. 1, 2, . . .).

'REDIM   Changes the dimension of the file.  The dimension of the output
           file is specified with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/grutil_level2.html#outdim">OUTDIM</A> parameter.  If the output
           dimension is smaller than the input then only the beginning
           coordinates are used.  If the output dimension is larger then
           the extra coordinates are zero.

'FILL    Adds points to line strings so there is a point every <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/grutil_level2.html#interval">INTERVAL</A>
	   distance.  Every point in the input file is transfered to the
	   output file.  If points in the original file are larger than the
	   specified distance apart, then points are added on the joining
	   lines with the appropriate spacing.  The distance calculations
	   are performed in 2-D, i.e. using the first two coordinates.

'SMOOTH  Lowers the spatial resolution of a graphics file by deleting points
	   so that the points are greater than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/grutil_level2.html#interval">INTERVAL</A> distance apart.
	   The first point in every line string is output.  Succeeding points
	   are output if they are greater than the specified distance from
	   the previously output point.  The distance calculations
	   are performed in 2-D, i.e. using the first two coordinates.
