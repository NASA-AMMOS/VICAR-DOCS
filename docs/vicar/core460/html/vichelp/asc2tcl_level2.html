<A NAME="sequence"><H3>SEQUENCE</H3></A>
<pre>
This will be the position of the desired item relative to either:

1.  the start of the file (default case)
2.  the line number specified by the lineno parameter, if it is not zero
3.  the first occurrence of the text matched by the keyword

in the case where both lineno and keyword is used, the program skips
to the line, then hunts for the first occurrence of the keyword, then
sequences to the desired item.  If the keyword is not found by the
end of the file, the search will NOT restart at the beginning.

<A NAME="keyword"><H3>KEYWORD</H3></A><pre>
The text given is case sensitive and must include the equals sign,
colon, or left parenthesis.  For example, if the file contains

       LOC=(35.332,118.927)

then the keyword must be 
      
       LOC=(

don't forget to declare the TAE TCL variable, proper type.

All floating values are double precision.

If the selection is not found, or wrong type, etc., a special value
of -999 (int) -999.0 (real) or "-999" (character string) is output
to the TAE TCL variable.

The types 2 and 7 are provided for convenience, TAE TCL has only the

this finds the keyword (usually in quotes in the file, do not use the
quotes in the vicar parameter) then looks for a subsequent VALUE   =
statement with a value in quotes again.  That value is converted and 
returned.
