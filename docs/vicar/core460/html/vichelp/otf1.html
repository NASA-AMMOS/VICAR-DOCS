PURPOSE:
 
   OTF1 is a VICAR applications program which performs one-dimensional
Fast Fourier Transformations in order to compute Optical Transfer
Functions (OTF) from degraded edges in images or from either a tabulated
real function, or a line spread function using parameter inputs. 

OTF1 is able to compute the entire optical transfer function (not just 
the MTF) from digital images with greater accuracy and ease than other
methods available. This technique for computing imaging system MTF's is 
preferable to previously used techniques which involved imaging of sine
wave targets.
OPERATION - INPUTS

There are three methods to input data to otf1 and one other internal
test call which requires no input data.

   The first way to input data is an image containing an edge spread
function. That data may have been derived from mathematical considerations
or maybe excised from a test target, shaded buildings, or planet limbs. 
All that is required is an image (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#inp">INP</A>) containing shapes such as (1) and (2).



          xxx                                      xxx
             x                                    x
              x                                  x
               x                                x
                x                              x
                 x                            x
                  xxxx                    xxxx
             (1)                                (2)
 

   The second method is to put in one line of DNs from an edge spread function
derived from data or mathematical considerations. In that case, You enter
data into the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> parameter. You may enter the data in either of the (1) or
(2) forms. You may enter up to 512 values. (If you have the patience).

   In the third method you can enter one line of DNs of a line spread function. 
In that case, you enter the DN values into the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> parameter. Again you may
enter up to 512 values. The entries are in floating point format although
they are processed to produce integer values.

   Finally, there is an internal self-test which requires no input, but is
invoked with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#sinctst">SINCTST</A> keyword parameter. SINCTST creates a SINC function 
and branches to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> processor.

  Only one type of input is allowed. If you were to enter multiple inputs
then the program would execute only one of them in the order <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#sinctst">SINCTST</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A>, 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#inp">INP</A>.
OPERATION - OUTPUTS

   After processing, the program provides output of the Fourier Transform
in terms of frequency, amplitude and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">phase</A> or frequency, real part of FFT
and imaginary part of FFT. If the user inputs the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">PHASE</A>=NOPHASE
parameter you can omit the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">phase</A> although internally it still computes it.
Recall, that the amplitude of the FFT is known as the modulation transfer 
function (MTF).

   The OUTPUTS of the final product can be produced in 3 forms. The first
is specified by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#out">OUT</A> parameter which is a vicar image consisting of
3 lines 124 samples long. The image is in REAL format. The first line
of the image is the frequency (cycles/pixel), the second line is the
the real part of the FFT and the third line is the imaginary part of
the FFT. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">phase</A> line is always included even if PHASE=NOPHASE was 
specified.

    The second type output is the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> parameter. This table is the
Modulation Transfer Function and consists of either two or three
ascii <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">columns</A>. When it is 3 columns it gives:

        Col 1 FREQUENCY        Col 2  AMPLITUDE        Col 3  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">PHASE</A>

When it is two <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">columns</A> it is

        Col 1 FREQUENCY        Col 2  AMPLITUDE

Column 3 is not given when the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">PHASE</A>=NOPHASE is specified. One other
parameter controls whether a column heading is created. That parameter i
is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">COLUMNS</A>=(COLHDR,NOCOLHDR). By default the header
("# FREQUENCY  AMPLITUDE   <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">PHASE</A>") is written as the first
record of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">table</A>. When you choose <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">COLUMNS</A>=NOCOLHDR it is not. Note
the leading # character allows certain plotting programs to ignore
suxch entries.

   Note that these products are only 124 data points long. Internally, the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> and PSF data are resampled  to 256 steps from whatever sample <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#size">size</A> is 
given in the input. Thus, 16 pixels, or whatever, will be expanded to 256.
However, due sampling theory the fourier transform is truncated at
spatial frequencies above 0.484 cycles per sample. This gives a symmeterical
FFT of 247 samples <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#out">out</A> of 256. What is given in the OUT, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A>
is only the right (124 steps) half of the Fourier transform (if viewed 
as having the DC at the center). To get the output translated to the way we
are used to seeing it, you need to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#reflect">reflect</A> the image or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">table</A> about the
center point to get the full 247 sample spectrum from 1.0 cycles/sample 
to 0.484 cycles/sample in separate Vicar steps.

   See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> discussion below

    The other types of output come from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotprof">PLOTPROF</A> parameters.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> displays the data in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#out">OUT</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> files on an x,y plot using
the gnuplot package. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> produces a file of gnuplot commands as shown
with a .gpi file extension.  It also produces a file with the .gpi.dat
extension. This is the data used for the plot using command in the gpi file.
It happens to be same data as in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> parameter (without the column 
headers), but since it can't be guaranteed that the user will create a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">table</A>, it creates its own.   

   The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotprof">PLOTPROF</A> parameter allows the user to display intermediate product
in the processing steps from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> to the fourier transform in pixel space,
i.e., in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#size">size</A> of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> input pixels, not in the resampled 
256 step mode.

OPERATION - INTERNALS

    In short, what is done is to convert

  edge spread function --&gt line spread function --> Modulation Transfer Function
                  by differentiation          by  FFT


    The edge spread function can be defined as the integral of one dimensional
pointspread functions. That is

                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A>(x) = Integral of (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>(x) dx)

                        d
                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>(x)  -- [<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A>(x)]
                        dx

  See: http://calval.cr.usgs.gov/JACIE_files/JACIE04/files/1Helde10.pdf for
  the Quickbird Satellite.

    Internally, the program takes in an <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> and increases it in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#size">size</A> 
to 256 samples. Thus, any <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> of small sample <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#size">size</A> will be resampled up to 256.
In this way, the output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> (unidirectional PS) which may be either in the
line or sample direction in the original image can be combined with another
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> in the orthogal direction to give a 2-D PSF.

The 2-D fft can be created from this and then convolved with a 256x256 image.
This represents the optical system blurring. Here convolution is multipling 
the 2 FFT's together.
 
   To aid in the preparation of filter weights for MTF enhancement, a provision
has been added to output the Real and Imaginary Fourier Transform components.
The output is 3 lines of 124 samples of Real*4 numbers organized as 
Line 1 [Frequency] 
Line 2 [Real Part of FFT],
Line 3 [Imaginary Part of FFT]

from 1.0 cycles/sample to 0.484 cycles/sample.
The output does not extend beyond 0.484 cycles/sample due to
limitations of the Sampling Theorem used for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> resampling (see last para-
graph of Method below).

             under Tutor.
METHOD:
 
   The data <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> normally in an input image and are processed line by line.
Each line is left adjusted into an array of dimension equal to the smallest
power of two which contain an entire input line. The data is then different-
iated to produce a Line Spread Function (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>). For direct input of a Line
Spread Function, the parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is followed by the LSF values (Real*4).
Processing will commence with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> ready for fillin to the nearest power
of two using the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#mean">MEAN</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#reflect">REFLECT</A>, or FILLIN parameters. For direct input of
a theortical "real" edge or mathematical function, the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> is
followed by a string of values (Real*4) and will be processed as thought it
was a real one-line image input. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#sinctst">SINCTST</A> will cause a SINC function to be
formed and processed as though it were the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> of an edge.
 
  The Maximum point in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is located and the LSF truncated to 30 points
on either side of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> Maximum. If there <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> less than 30 points to either
side the option exists to fill in extra points by replecating the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#mean">mean</A>,
by reflection, or with zeros. This <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is then left justified and the Sampling
Theorem applied to produce a 256 point power spectrum. In addition the
resampled <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is folded about the maximum, with points from the maximum to the
upper end placed from i=1 to the midpoint, and points from the maximum to the
lower end placed from near the midpoint to 1=256. This array is then in the
proper form upon which the subroutine FFTT can be used to perform an inverse
transform. The real and imaginary components of the transform for each line
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> accumulated element by element, and these operations continued until all
the image lines have been processed. From the accumulated real and imaginary
transform components the following <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> computed and printed.
   Given a complex FT element "a+ib" the output will consist of:
 
(1) The spatial frequency in cycles/pixel.
(2) The actual frequency in cycles/unit of time (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#interval">INTERVAL</A>).
(3) a=Real part of FT.
(4) b=Imaginary part of FT.
(5) SQRT(a**2+b**2)=The amplitude of the FT. This is also the MTF if the
    input data is an <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>.
(6) (a**2+b**2)=The power spectrum or intensity of the FT.
(7) The Normalized amplitude of the MTF which will be plotted.
(8) ACRTAN(b/a)=The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">phase</A> angle Omega of the FT measured in radians
    which will also be plotted
(9) W=Omega/2*pi*F=The displacement in the same units as <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#interval">INTERVAL</A>
    (the default of which is samples) of each sine wave component in
    the image from its true position in the object being imaged. F is
    in units of 1/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#interval">INTERVAL</A>. This quantity is meaningful if the input
    data is an <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> and if OTF has been specified.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> was specified the Normalized MTF Amplitude and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">Phase</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> processed
into an output file containing gnuplot instructions (gpi).
In this case the terminal screen plot is disabled.
 
The default is to generate a display of the pertinent on the terminal screen
components of the OTF in a crude but rapidly analyzable format. Each
curve's data points <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> represented by a letter with the following code:
 
   A   Amplitude of the FT
   R   Real portion of the FT
   I   Imaginary portion of the FT
   W   Wavelength shift of the FT.
The FT is computed from
 
           N-1
    FT =SUM    [DATA *Exp(-2*PI*inm/N)]                   (1)
           n=0      n
 
where N is the data string length and  0&ltm<(N-1).
 
   The OTF section of the program is designed to generate an <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> positioned
in such a way as to eliminate both the effects of sampling and the bias
introduced into the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#phase">phase</A> OMEGA due to the arbitrary positioning of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>
data in the input array. Users of FFTT have been forced to obtain clean
OTF's by using symmetrical <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s positoned half at the beginning of the
data string and half at the end. This was inconvenient and impossible if
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> was asymmetrical. In the latter event all they could do was settle
for the MTF, never knowing what the OTF was like. In a situation where the
OTF has gone negative, the MTF is dangerous to use as a restoration function
because it will boost the negative amplitudes the wrong way. The OTF allows
the user to visualize the scrambling of spatial frequencies which occur when
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is asymmetrical, and also to see the sign of the OTF (given by the
real part of the FT).
 
   There <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> two problems associated with generating unbiased OTF's. They
can be solved simultaneously by use of the Sampling Theorem. If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is
computed from a degraded edge composed of digital data, it is clear that
(particularly for narrow <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s) the position of the sampled points is going
to influence the symmetry of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>. Clearly, trying to dissect several
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s into two halves (each different) and store them at opposite ends of
the data string before the FT operation, is going to produce different OTF's
each time. Because the data is band limited, at least at the Nyquist Frequency,
the MTF's generated in the above case will all be about the same. The problem
is to eliminate the effects of sampling. The Sampling Theorem is used by OTF1
to resample the acquired <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> about its center of weight. At this point, if the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> is asymmetrical, the effect is real.
   In computing the weight center of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> a first moments algorithm is
used:
 
              n=N                  n=N
    CENTER=SUM   [(n-1)*DATA ]/ SUM   [DATA ]               (2)
              n=1           n      n=1     n
 
The Data <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> then resampled about the CENTER position using
 
            n=+INF
    INT =SUM      [DATA *((SIN(x-n)*PI)/((x-n)*PI))]          (3)
       x    n=-INF     n
 
where x is some integer distance away from CENTER. The data can then be
split about the located center and positioned properly in the array to be
transformed.
 
   The use of many <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s to produce one OTF is done by averaging the
transform components. Averaging MTF's (if that's what you want) can be
erroneous because even OTF's, which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> in reality positive, can be
caused to go negative if one of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s is afflicted with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#noise">noise</A>. Since
the MTF is the modulus of the OTF, the MTF is always positive. Great care
should be taken in inspecting the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s computed from pictures before the
resampling step to be sure they look decent. Averaged runs of 50 or more
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A>'s should yield OTF's which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> accurate to within a few percent. This
is an order of magnitude better than the sine wave methods used in the past.
 
   Because the Sampling Theorem summation limits must be finite (in this
case +/- 128) the theorem is blind to the spatial frequencies above 0.484
cycles per sample. The OTF values above this frequency <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> best obtained
by extrapolating from values below 0.484 to the Nyquest limit.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> displays the data in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#out">OUT</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> files on an x,y plot using
the gnuplot package. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> produces a file of gnuplot commands as shown
with a .gpi file extension.  Another file with an .asc extension is createid
containing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">columns</A> of data that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> displayed by the gpi file.
It happens to be same data as in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">TABLE</A> parameter (without the column
headers), but since it can't be guaranteed that the user will create a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#table">table</A>, it creates its own.

   The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotprof">PLOTPROF</A> parameter allows the user to display intermediate product
in the processing steps from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> to the fourier transform in pixel space,
i.e., in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#size">size</A> of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#esf">ESF</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#lsf">LSF</A> input pixels, not in the resampled
256 step mode.

   The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A> parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A>=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.


  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A> parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotout">PLOTOUT</A>=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> produced:

     outplot.gpi
     outplot.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#plotfmt">PLOTFMT</A>=eps
  then the following files <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     outplot.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps
  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'outplot.asc' u  1: 9 t .......

USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> written <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#out">out</A> as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#columns">columns</A> of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi
  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates multiple output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.

  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/otf1_level2.html#are">are</A> used.
