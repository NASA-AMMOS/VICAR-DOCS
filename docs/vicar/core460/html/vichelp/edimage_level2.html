    Input datasets may be images, optional IBIS graphics files, or lookup
table files. If no output image is specified, then the input image is modified
by the program. If an output image is given, then the input image is copied to 
the output image upon execution of the program.  Optional IBIS graphics files 
are used by the program in 3 modes.  They may 1) be displayed on the graphics 
plane for reference (such as a coastal outline); 2) contain closed polygons 
to be used by the program for polygonal operations (such as filling and 
copying); and 3) be drawn into either the image or graphics planes of the 
video memory.  The same filename can be used for an input and output graphics 
file (even if the file does not exist upon entering the program from the Vicar
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> line).  This allows the user to create polygonal graphics files from 
within the program and save them to the output graphics file.  Similarly, 
lookup table files can be specified in the input and output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> fields, 
generated from within the program, and saved and restored as desired.  The
lookup tables have the same format as those used by programs IDX and LOOKUP. 
If the input images (color <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#mode">mode</A>) are being modified, they must have different 
filenames.  A total of 10 input files are supported by the program.

    Output datasets may be images, IBIS graphics files, or color lookup
table files.  All three file types are optional.

Some possible examples are as follows:

 edimage MONALISA.BW			No output - input modified
 edimage MONALISA.BW NEWMONA.BW		Modified output image NEWMONA.BW
 edimage (MONA.R,MONA.G,MONA.B,MONA.GRA,MONA.TBL) +       Modified image will
	 (LISA.R,LISA.G,LISA.B,MONA.GRA,MONA.TBL) 'COLOR  will be written to
						          to the LISA.* files. 
Notice that the same name is given to the input and output files MONA.GRA 
and MONA.TBL, allowing graphics to be generated from within the program, 
saved to MONA.GRA and restored from input MONA.GRA at a later time within 
the same program session.  The same is true for the MONA.TBL color lookup 
table file.  A total of 10 output files may be specified from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> line.

<A NAME="size"><H3>SIZE</H3></A><pre>
The standard Vicar <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#size">size</A> field used for determining the window to copy to 
the output image.  This parameter is ignored if there are no output images
and the editing is being conducted on the input images.

<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
    This is the keyword used for distinguishing between color and black and 
white <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#mode">mode</A>. The program has no way of determining, without the MODE keyword, 
if one image and several IBIS graphics files and/or color lookup table files 
have been specified or if there are three images and optional files specified.

<A NAME="screen"><H3>SCREEN</H3></A><pre>
    The part of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#screen">screen</A> unused for image display may be used as a scratch-
pad, and it sometimes occurs that one wishes to use parts of various images
displayed on the image planes from a previous use of the display processor(eg,
another session of "edimage" or perhaps IDX).  By default "edimage" will clear the
image planes before the session begins(<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#screen">SCREEN</A>="CLEAR").
The 'NOCLR keywork preserves whatever was on the image planes
before "edimage" was invoked;  This can be used to piece together
a lot of unrelated images displayed previously with IDX, etc.

<A NAME="test"><H3>TEST</H3></A><pre>
   The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#test">TEST</A> parameter enables test <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.  The test mode differs from the
normal <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#mode">mode</A> only in that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> lines are read using TAE parameter
processing, treating each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> line as a single string.  This allows
"edimage" to be run from a TAE script file.  Each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/edimage_level2.html#command">command</A> line must be
enclosed in quotes if there are any embedded blanks.
