<pre>
 In the forward mode, only one input is allowed.

 In the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#reverse">reverse</A> mode, up to three input files are allowed.  The first
 input  is  the  picture on which to operate, the second input is the
 modified  amplitude picture, and the third input is (optionally) the
 modified phase picture.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
 Up to two outputs are allowed.  No output is needed if only the page
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#plot">plot</A> is desired.

 If  only one output is provided, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#type">type</A> of output is controlled by
 the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#type">TYPE</A> parameter.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="type"><H3>TYPE</H3></A><pre>
 If  two  output  files  are given, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#type">TYPE</A> is ignored, and an amplitude
 picture  is  written to the first output, and a phase picture to the
 second. 

 If  only  one  output  is  specified, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#type">TYPE</A> controls the type of
 output;  AMPL  specifies  an amplitude output, and PHASE specifies a
 phase output.

<A NAME="log"><H3>LOG</H3></A><pre>
 If  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#log">LOG</A>  is  specified,  then the logarithm of the amplitude picture
 output.   This  is  recommended  if  the  amplitude picture is to be
 MASK'ed or FOTO'ed.

<A NAME="spike"><H3>SPIKE</H3></A><pre>

 If  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#spike">SPIKE</A>  is  given,  then  each  line  of the amplitude picture is
 normalized  to  the  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#spike">SPIKE</A>'th peak for that line.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> is also
 specified,  then each line is normalized to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#spike">SPIKE</A>'th peak of the
 first line.  (default = <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/fft1pix_level2.html#dc">dc</A> term)
