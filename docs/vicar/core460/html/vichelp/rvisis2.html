VICAR program VISIS2 converts Galileo NIMS cubes (generated by program
NIMSCMM2) between VICAR and ISIS format.  Its calling sequence is
somewhat complex, reflecting the fact that a single ISIS cube becomes
multiple VICAR files, one for each object in the ISIS cube.  Therefore,
this procedure is provided in order to cover most cases with a simple
command line.

NOTE:  during Galileo Systematic Processing on MIPS, the functionality 
of RVISIS2 was implemented in procedure SYSNIMS2, which also included
the option of generating a NIMS Mask product.  The latter option is
not supported by RVISIS2, although the capability of processing an ISIS
cube containing the spectral plots of a Mask was retained.  Note that
SYSNIMS2 ran in forward mode only, and ran only under VMS.  Cubes made
by MIPS Systematic processing had names ending in the string "MSYnn".
Calling sequence:

&gt RVISIS2 name [optional parameters]

where "name" is the cube filename, without directory (which may be 
specified by a separate parameter) or suffix.  Note that the cube 
suffix (filetype) cannot be specified freely, so the user is restricted 
to the following combinations for the two primary VICAR files, the
cube and the co-cube:

   VICAR  &lt-&gt  ISIS        description
  CUB,COC     QUB	default case: radiance (projected) G-cube
  CIOF,COC    IOF	IOF G-cube
  TUB,COT     VTUB	radiance unprojected tube
  XTUB,XCOT   VXTUB	tube with co-added mirror positions (point source)
  TIOF,COT    VIOF	IOF tube

E.g., the ISIS cube 33JNGLOBAL01A_MSY01.QUB corresponds to the VICAR
cube and co-cube files 33JNGLOBAL01A_MSY01.CUB and 33JNGLOBAL01A_MSY01.COC.

Anything else must be done by running VISIS2 by hand.

The ISIS cube also always contains a 2-D Histogram object, which is
stored in a third VICAR file, which this proc always names 2DHIST.

In inverse mode, the History object will be stored in a VICAR file 
with the filetype LAB.  In forward mode, if task=VISIS2, then the
presence of this file is required.

In inverse mode, the following additional files may be created if
the corresponding objects are present in the ISIS cube (in which
case, this *must* be indicated by the parameters SII and/or PLOTS):

SII = spectral-index image (if this is present, then PLOTS may only
 be 0 or 6, to keep the procedure from being excessively complicated);

SP1 ... SP6 = one to six spectrum plot files

The maximum number of objects in the ISIS cube is 11:  cube, co-cube,
2D-histogram, spectral-index image, six spectrum plots, and history.
(The cube also has a label object, but this does not have a separate
VICAR file, but is instead converted to the VICAR cube label.)
