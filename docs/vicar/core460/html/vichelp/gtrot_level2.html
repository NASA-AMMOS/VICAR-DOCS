Use this to specify the desired rotation and the program will do the rest.

This program rotates VICAR image datasets that have a GeoTIFF label.  The
program can figure <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/gtrot_level2.html#out">out</A> what rotation the input has from the GeoTIFF label.
The rotation is defined as the ordering of pixel samples (the minor order)
and image lines (the major order) with respect to an East-North map system
(or an X-Y map system in GeoTIFF terms).  The eight possible rotations can
be represented by the following diagrams (here, pixel value represents the
order of data in the file): 


   369    123    741    987
0: 258 1: 456 2: 852 3: 654
   147    789    963    321

   963    789    147    321
4: 852 5: 456 6: 258 7: 654
   741    123    369    987

Note that rotation 1 is the VICAR standard rotation.  Rotation 0
is the USGS and DMA standard, for example, DTED data.

The user does not have to figure <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/gtrot_level2.html#out">out</A> how many 90 degree turns or
flips to apply to an image to get the VICAR standard anymore (for
the GeoTIFF case), the program only needs the value of the output
rotation in the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/gtrot_level2.html#rot">ROT</A>.  The parameter defaults to one
which is the VICAR standard.

All 64 transformations are possible in this program (the old VICAR
program can only do some of the transformations, others require two
executions).  For information only, the transformations are shown
here:

	  no flip              flip

rotate 0  90 180 270      0  90 180 270

   0)  0   3   2   1      4   5   6   7
   1)  1   0   3   2      5   6   7   4
   2)  2   1   0   3      6   7   4   5
   3)  3   2   1   0      7   4   5   6
   4)  4   5   6   7      0   3   2   1
   5)  5   6   7   4      1   0   3   2
   6)  6   7   4   5      2   1   0   3
   7)  7   4   5   6      3   2   1   0

For algebra buffs, the set of 8 rotations is a non-Abelian group
generated by the flip and rotate 90 operations.  It is the smallest
non-Abelian group.

In addition, rotate updates the rotation value in the label.
