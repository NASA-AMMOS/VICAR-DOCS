PURPOSE

     MF   allows   the  user  to  create  FORTRAN or C -like 
     expressions to perform general mathematical operations on 
     one  or more IBIS/graphics file columns.   The  expressions 
     are  written as a parameter string.   The parameter  is 
     interpreted  to determine the input and output  columns 
     and   operations  to  be  performed.    The   variables 
     representing  a data column are written as keywords  to 
     allow  the user flexibility in writing the  expression.  
     The functions available are:  SQRT, ALOG, ALOG10, AINT, 
     SIN,  COS TAN,  ASIN,  ACOS,  ATAN,  ATAN2, ABS, MIN or 
     AMIN1,  MAX  or  AMAX1,  and MOD or  AMOD,  along  with 
     standard binary operations +,  -,  *,  /, **, and logic 
     operations,   .AND.,   .OR.,   .XOR.,  and  .NOT.   All 
     operations operate as in FORTRAN IV and C.   A  special 
     feature   allows   for   the  calculation   of   column 
     statistics.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     MF <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=int PARAMS

     where

     int                 is a random access file.  Since it
                         is used for both input and  output, 
                         no output file is specified.

     PARAMS              is   a  standard  VICAR   parameter 
                         field.

    The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#gr1dim">GR1DIM</A> specifies the (Graphics-1) Dimension.

    The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#zeroes">ZEROES</A> parameters specifies whether to process rows
    with all <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#zeroes">zeroes</A>. The permitted options are: SKIP and
    INCLUDE. INCLUDE is the default.

    The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#code">CODE</A> parameter will show the pseudo instructions for
    math and logic functions. The nmenomics are the same
    as for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#code">CODE</A> parameter for mf but have different
    operands. No pseudo instructions are generated for
    column opearations.

METHOD

     MF performs arithmetic operations on an interface file.  
     The  program  uses  two  library  routines KNUTH  and 
     XKNUTH,   to   compile  and  interpret   FORTRAN or C  like 
     expressions  entered by the parameters in an expression 
     such as:

                     C35 = (100*C34)/C4

     In this expression,  C34 and C4 are the input  columns.  
     KNUTH    compiles   the   expression   into    machine 
     instructions.   The  expression is applied to the input 
     column in XKNUTH to produce the output column, C35. For
     compatibility with program GF, the variable names X5,
     etc, may be used in place of C5, etc.


RESTRICTIONS

     Maximum number of columns in one execution is 50.
<A NAME="examples">EXAMPLE</A>

     MF <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#inp">INP</A>=FILE.INT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>=("C5 = C2/C3+100+SQRT(C2)")

     In this example,  C2 is divided by C3 and added to  100 
     plus the square root of C2.   The results are placed in 
     C5.  Further examples of allowable functions follow:

                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>=("C5 = !(C3  || C2)")

     logical   operations  are  performed  bitwise  on   the 
     operands. The  logical values T and F are converted to 1.  and 0. 
     for storage in column C5

                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>=("X5 = X3.LE.INDEX")

     Column 5 is 1.0 if column 3 has a value &lt its row value (INDEX).
     
                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>=("X5 = POLY * 2")

     the operator POLY returns the current polygon number,
     where polygons are delimited by rows of all zero values.

                <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core460/html/vichelp/mf_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A>=("C5 = #MEAN(C3)")

     In this example, the mean of column 3 is calculated and 
     that  value is placed in every row entry in  column  5.  
     This  operation  is different than the  arithmetic  and 
     logic operations given earlier because it operates on a 
     vertical  column instead of horizontally across a  row.  
     These  operations  cannot  be  used  in  an  arithmetic 
     expression  such as C5 = #MEAN(C3)*10.   The  allowable 
     column operations are:

                       C2 = #MEAN(C4)
                       C2 = #SIGMA(C4)
                       C2 = #MIN(C4)
                       C2 = #MAX(C4)
                       C2 = #FIRST(C4)
                       C2 = #SUM(C4)
                       C2 = #RSUM(C4) (running sum)
                       C2 = #RDIFF(C4) (running diff)
