PURPOSE:

INSERT3D will place a 2-d band (also called a depth) into 
a 3d file. The band may be inserted between 2 existing 
bands or written over an existing band. The keyword 
'OVER causes overwriting. Inserting is the default.
The first input file is the 3-D file that will receive
the band and the second input is the band to be inserted. 
The output receives the final product unless 'UPDATE is
specified in which case the band is written into the
primary input, and the output file, if present, is ignored.

Example:    INSERT3D  (A,B) C BAND=23 'OVER

Writes B as band 23 over band 23 in A with C receiving the updated
3-D file. A and B are left unchanged.

The file, A, must be a 3-D file in band-sequential organization and B 
a 2-D band (or depth) with the same cross-section (number of lines
and samples) as A.

The program, TRAN, may be used to change the organization of a file.

Example:    INSERT3D (A,B) BAND=116 'UPDATE

Here, the band in B is written directly into A in update mode.

'UPDATE implies 'OVER. The band count of A can not increse in 'UPDATE
mode.

Note that INSERT3D can insert a band into a file after the previous
last band. The BAND value must be one greater than the last band number.
