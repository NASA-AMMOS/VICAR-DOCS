OPERATION

NXT reads a list file which was written by the program SRCH and 
returns information about the next file in the list.  The values 
are returned in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#onam">ONAM</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#istape">ISTAPE</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#tapepos">TAPEPOS</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#nxtfil">NXTFIL</A>.  Upon completion, ONAM
contains the name of the disk file or tape position which is next in the list.

If the file is a tape, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#istape">ISTAPE</A> will be 1, otherwise it will be 0.

If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#istape">ISTAPE</A> is 1, then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#tapepos">TAPEPOS</A> will contain the file position number on 
the tape.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#nxtfil">NXTFIL</A> contains the (ordinal) number of the returned file within the list file.

NXT needs to have write access to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#input">input</A> file and to its directory because
it modifies the first record of the file.  The recommended method for accessing
a SRCH file owned by another user is to make a copy of it in one's account.


HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE

This program was written for processing files from a 9-track tape on
a VAX-VMS system in the 1980's. In those days disk space was limited,
so tape was the medium of archival storage and data interchange.

Tapes came in two forms; with and without IBM standard labels. Standard
label tape allowed file names to be associated with a position on the
tape. If the tape was not labeled then you could only access data
by knowing its position on the tape. This program performed this
function for you by relating an entry in an ascii text list of files
to a position on a tape and then creating a disk file with a filename.

The example, below shows historically how this was done under VAX-VMS.

Now this program gives you the ability to access files quickly from
a list, thus avoiding a human manual entry.
<A NAME="examples">EXAMPLE:</A>

The following procedure could be used to get a list of the 
system label of each file in the list file LIST.DAT.

  LOCAL POSITION TYPE=INT
  LOCAL FILENUM TYPE=INT
BODY
  RESET LIST.DAT
  write ('resetting')

REVISIONS:

  1986-09    SP  Changed fscanf to sscanf and changed                  
                 format specifier from "%5d" to "10%d"                 
                 to allow users to modify the first record in file.    
                 Added code to check for first record having a         
                 different length than expected and to handle this.    
                 Modified to output to a TAE variable the number of the
                 file (as done in program CNT) per Charlie Avis.       
                 Note that this change the calling sequence of NXT by  
                 adding another required parameter, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/nxt_level2.html#nxtfil">NXTFIL</A>.            
  1987-02    SP  Added code to handle  NO RECORDS in SRCH file.        
  1994-06    SVH Ported to UNIX - Steve Hwan				
  1996-06    OAM Included a REWIND statement and a loop in the VMS part
	         to avoid dropping filenames as it updates the NEXT FILE
                 number.  FR 89371.
  1997-08    RRD Added first fseek call after #else (the UNIX specific 
                 section) because a previous call to fscanf had moved 
                 the current position in the file and this fixes it.
  1998-07    TIH Changed constant value with FILENAME_LEN to fix       
  2011-10    LWK Increased pool size in q_init call from 500 to 1000   
                 to fix V-block overflow in 64-bit linux.             
  2012-12-09 RJB fixed warnings with gcc 4.7.2         
                 moved variables c and ounit into #ifdef VMS_OS block   
  2012-12-14 RJB Doc update.
  2016-03-07 WLB Switched to ANSI_C. Removed VMS residue. Migrated to MIPL.
  2019-06-13 WLB IDS-7922: Initialized some variables.
                 IDS-7924: Switched to constant formatting string.
		 IDS-7925: Null-terminated some strings.
