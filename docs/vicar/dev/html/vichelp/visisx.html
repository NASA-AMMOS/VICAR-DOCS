PURPOSE:

 VISISX transforms from a Vicar 3-D image file to an ISIS Cube file
 and vice versa.

EXECUTION:

VISIS2 input output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> [suffix-images] [<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#histfile">histfile</A>] [<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#taskname">taskname</A>]

where "input" and "output" are Vicar and ISIS files, in a sequence
determined by "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>", the suffix-images are separate files in Vicar
but part of the cube in ISIS, and "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#histfile">histfile</A>" is an optional ascii text 
file containing an ISIS History object.  If label processing is to be
done (in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> only), then "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#taskname">taskname</A>" must be specified to denote 
the task from which the history labels are to be taken.

The suffix images are optional.  If they are omitted in TOVICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>,
then any suffix data in the ISIS cube will simply be skipped over.  If 
they are specified in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, then the images will be checked for
consistency of dimensions with the core.  Currently, only backplanes
are supported in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.

Suffix planes / bands:

The Vicar cube file is stored as the Core of the ISIS cube.  The
suffixes are stored as separate image files in Vicar, but as part of
the cube in ISIS.  There are three kinds of suffixes: sideplanes,
backplanes, and bottomplanes.  This terminology comes from applications
in which two of the three cube dimensions are spatial and one spectral,
with the two spatial dimensions constituting the "front" view of the
cube, while the spectral one is the "depth".  For other applications,
these terms lose their meaning, but are retained here since spatial-
spectral cubes are the most common types currently used by VICAR.
Here are their definitions in terms of the storage orders supported
by VISISX:

Band-Sequential (BSQ) storage order, in which Sample is the most
rapidly varying dimension, then Line, then Band:
  Sideplanes are stored at the end of each line.
  Bottomplanes are stored at the end of the last line of each band.
  Backplanes are stored at the end of the cube.

Band-Interleaved by Line (BIL) storage order, in which Sample is the 
most rapidly varying dimension, then Band, then Line:
  Sideplanes are stored at the end of each line.
  Backplanes are stored at the end of the last band of each line.
  Bottomplanes are  stored at the end of the cube.

These are the only storage orders supported by VISISX.

Note that suffix planes are only allowed at the end of their
corresponding dimension, not at the beginning.
Not all combinations are supported.  Backplanes are supported
for all modes, but sideplanes and bottomplanes are only supported
for BIL format and in TOVICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> (for Cassini VIMS).  For this
case, here is the detailed specification of the dimensionalities:

Let the Core of the cube have the dimensions C1, C2, C3 (in order from
most to least rapid variation), and let the width of the suffix planes
be S1, S2, S3 (in the order Sideplane, Backplane, Bottomplane), then the
corresponding image dimensions will be:

Sideplane:   S1, C2, C3.
Backplane:   C1+S1, S2, C3.
Bottomplane: C1+S1, C2+S2, S3.

I.e., the "corners" formed by two successive suffix planes are included in
the second of each sequence.  

Again, note that the above schema is for BIL format only.
Assumptions and Restrictions:

1. All suffix planes are assumed to be in 4-byte (real or integer) format.
 (Additionally, VIMS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#side">side</A>- and bottomplanes are always integers.)

2. Currently, only BSQ and BIL file organizations are supported.

3. The maximum BAND dimension allowed is 500.

1998-12-09 lwk - added U_NL/S to zvopens in get_recinfo (for Solaris)
1998-12-16 lwk - added support for BIL files and for SUFFIX planes 
           (TOVICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> only, not saved!);  specified "int" for functions 
           that return values
1998-12-18 lwk - added <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#host">HOST</A> parameter
1999-01-18 lwk - fixed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#host">HOST</A> parameter
1999-01-22 lwk - fixed CORE_ITEMS in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> (was broken when BIL added),
           and CORE_ITEM_TYPE (was VAX-only); added CORE_NAME & CORE_UNIT as 
           they're required by Unix ISIS
1999-01-26 lwk - use zvhost for int/realfmt
1999-01-30 lwk - replaced <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#host">HOST</A> parameter in TOVICAR by search on CORE_ITEM_TYPE
1999-02-01 lwk - treat NATIVE_TIMEs differently per project (tovicar <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A> only)
1999-02-02 lwk - added "U_ORG","BSQ" to zvopen in write_object (TOISIS) to fix
           problem with BIL cubes
1999-04-22 lwk - skip over the AXIS_NAME item in the specplot part of the label
           for the case of a NIMS cube
1999-06-06 lwk - allow for partial subset of labels depending on 'maplabs'
           flag -- this is designed to allow NIMSSKY cubes to be processed, but
           ideally each label item should be checked separately
1999-09-13 lwk - check for ORTHOGRAPHIC alone and replace by OBLIQUE_ORTHO;
           start search for map keywords at "GROUP = IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION",
           since some cubes have RADIUS keywords before MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE
2000-06-19 lwk - removed objectindex stuff from keyword_value (since we have
           only 1 object containing labels);  deleted a few residual "NIMS"s
           and function byte_nibble;  added EAST/WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDEs to
           ISIS-&gtVICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>
2000-06-20 bam - added new keywords FIRST_LINE_SAMPLE, LINE_EXPOSURE_DURATION,
           START_TIME, and EASTERNMOST/WESTERNMOST LONGITUDE (these replace
           MINIMUM/MAXIMUM LONGITUDE in the newer files). I have also added a
           new function for double precision values, get_double_value, and
           modified the code to accept this new function.  This is necessary
           for port to LINUX.
2000-07-11 lwk - fixed bug checking for map labels in ToVic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>

           all references to "forward/backward" modes with "toisis/tovicar"
2004-05-22 lwk - added VIMS keywords: START/STOP_TIME (need special function
           find_keyword_str to distinguish from NATIVE_TIME), INTERLINE_DELAY,
           EXPOSURE_DURATION, X/Z_OFFSET
2004-06-01 lwk - added VIMS keywords SAMPLING_MODE_ID & SCAN_MODE_ID;  fiddled
           with string delimiters in get_string_value() (again)
2004-06-15 lwk - changed algorithm for distinguishing NATIVE_TIME and plain
           TIME, since Cassini has now made both strings
2004-06-18 lwk - allow backplanes from co-cube in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>;  changed treatment
           of the various suffix planes
2004-06-22 lwk - translate CORE_NAME/UNIT to Vicar items; added BAND_SUFFIX items
           for display of backplanes in cv

           find SUFFIX_ITEM_TYPE
2004-09-22 lwk - added more VIMS keywords at CCA's request;  fiddled some more with
           the code for START_TIME & NATIVE_START_TIME (latter can be with or without
           quotes!)
2004-10-12 lwk - enabled fullword integer support in TOVICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>; added label items
           BAND_BIN_ORIGINAL_BAND/ORIGBANDS and (in VICAR) WAVUNIT;  read TARGET name
           in TOISIS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visisx_level2.html#mode">mode</A>
