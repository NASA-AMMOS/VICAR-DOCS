The input file should be a file from an SDDPT CD-ROM, or an exact copy of
such a file.  The file should be originally from the transcription of a
7 track, 1/2 inch CCT tape, and contain an IBM VICAR label.  Files from 9 
track tapes, and files that have had VICAR2 labels added to them will be 
handled improperly.

The output file will be a file with a standard VICAR2 label.  The history
labels from the old IBM VICAR label will be preserved as comments in the
new label.

It was observed in the test datasets that there is sometimes a "loss of
sync" when reading the input dataset.  This appears to be associated with
read errors in the original transcription from the 7 track tape, and is
usually accompanied by a missing line, lines, or part of a line.
      In the default mode, whenever a loss of sync is detected, the previous
output line is repeated, and processing moves to the nearest sync mark.
Specifying the '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/from7trk_level2.html#noadd">NOADD</A> option suppresses the addition of these duplicate
lines.
