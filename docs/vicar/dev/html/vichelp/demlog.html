PURPOSE:
     DEMLOG logs into VICAR format DEM (Digital Elevation Model) files obtained
from the USGS. Specifically, this program will log usgs DEM FILES that are in 
the format described in the USGS National Mapping Division Open-file Report 
86-004 "Standards for Digital Elevation Models".
     This format differs from the ones known to VDEMLOG and DTTLOG; it involves
unlabelled tapes with fixed length blocksize of some multiple of 1024 bytes. 
All data are stored as ASCII characters in 1024 byte logical records.

                            ***UPDATE***
     The program has been modified to handle datasets with carriage return
delimited records.  These files may be identified by their having a
dataset length that is a multiple of 1025, rather than 1024.  To process
this type of file, use the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/demlog_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A>=0

     The output of this procedure has been rotated to make North be the 
top of the image.

     Numerous options are documented in the document referenced above that
have not been implemented.  If you have a dataset that this program should
log, but does not, please contact Ron Alley x40751.
EXECUTION:

Examples

DEMLOG  TAPE/4 OUTIMAGE

This command will log the 4th file on the specified drive's tape from
DEM-format into VICAR format. No parameter or SIZE field is allowed.  


DEMLOG TAPE/2 TOPO <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/demlog_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A>=19

This command will log the second file onthe specified drive's tape. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/demlog_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A>=19
implies that there are 19 x 1024 = 19,456 bytes per <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/demlog_level2.html#block">block</A> on the tape.
