<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input stereo pair.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving different (and presumably better) output coordinates.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstiexyz.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstiexyz.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstiexyz.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system. These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model out parallax between the
stereo cameras. The options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY which means no surface
is used, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface = PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters.  For the cases when PLANE 
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection 
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, 
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same. Last, MESH is a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
model defined by a mesh file (.obj) which path is given with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_mesh">SURF_MESH</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_mesh"><H3>SURF_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Mesh OBJ file to use as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model. For the mesh to be used,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> must be set to MESH. The coordinates of the mesh vertices can be 
expressed in any CS. However the mesh CS must be supplied via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A>.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> is not used, then the mesh is assumed to be to the CS that
results from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>

VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> 
File name of a vicar file whose CS (contained in the labels) will be read and
assigned to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> model. The type of image and its content are of no
interest, we are just reading the CS. That CS will supersede any other <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
CS definition (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>). Its typical use is to supply a CS to a
given mesh file (expectedly the XYZ from which the mesh is computed from, but
doesn't have to). But <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> could be use to define a CS in which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> 
and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> for a PLANE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#surface">surface</A> are expressed in.

<A NAME="tiepoints"><H3>TIEPOINTS</H3></A><pre>
Input tiepoint file for tiepoint visualization.  Only used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tie_type">TIE_TYPE</A>
is turned on.  Both the old (text) and new (XML) tiepoint file formats
are supported, and the format is auto-detected.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tie_type"><H3>TIE_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Allows <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> to be visualized by plotting them on top of a mosaic.
Should never be used for production mosaics; this is intended to help
determine if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> (such as from MARSAUTOTIE) are any good.

The default value, NO_TIES, turns off tiepoint visualization completely.

POINTS turns on point mode.  The left side of the tiepoint is indicated
by a dot (single pixel) on the image at the location that point projects to.
The value of the pixel is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tie_dn">TIE_DN</A> plus 10 times the difference (in mosaic
space) between the left and right parts of the tiepoint.  This gives some
indication of how well the tiepoint was corrected.  Thus if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tie_dn">TIE_DN</A> is 7000,
a value of 7032 indicates that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marstiexyz_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> were 3.2 pixels apart.  Of
course, a difference of 0 (dn=7000 for this example) means that the tiepoint
was corrected perfectly.

FLAG does what POINTS does, but then draws an additional vector on the
image (at half the intensity of the point).  This vector starts at the point
and continues for 10 pixels parallel to a line between the centers of the
"left" and "right" images for that tiepoint.  Thus it provides some indication
of which pair of images was involved in the tiepoint, when there are multiple
overlapping images.  Note that the edge of the mosaic is not considered; if
the image centers are on opposite ends of the mosaic (as in, the edge of the
mosaic splits the centers), the vector will use the actual centers, without
being adjusted for wrapping.

VECTOR does what POINTS does, but then draws an additional vector on the
image (at half the intensity of the point).  This vector starts at the point
and continues in the direction of the right-side tiepoint.  The length of the
vector is 10 times the difference between the left and right (same as the
intensity of the point itself).  This makes it easy to visualize tiepoint
outliers.

Tiepoint visualization is especially effective when combined with -NUMBER and
-OVER (overlapping footprints).  The -FLAG or -VECTOR modes should almost
always be used; POINT alone has not proved to be useful.
