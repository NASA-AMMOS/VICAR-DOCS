"tristim" is a Vicar applications program that will calculate the tristimulus
values and chromaticity coordinates for a given spectrum, which may be of
intensity, reflectivity, or transmittivity. Tristimulus values and chromaticity
coordinates are quantities which must be known to do color reconstruction.  
For a complete discussion of colorimetry, see Reference 1.
 
EXECUTION:

tristim PARAMS

where PARAMS are parameters listed in Tutor mode.  (There are no input or
output datasets.)
OPERATION:
 
"tristim" computes tristimulus values for a spectrum by the formulas:
 
  X = k * SUM( F(i) * x'(i) )
  Y = k * SUM( F(i) * y'(i) )
  Z = k * SUM( F(i) * z'(i) )
 
where:   X, Y, and Z are the tristimulus values,
 
         F is the input spectral distribution of intensity, reflectivity,
         or transmittivity.
 
         x', y', and z' are the C.I.E. standard colorimetric observer
         values, also known as the color matching functions, optionally
         weighted by a specified illuminant,
 
         and i is the wavelength.
 
The sums are taken from i = 380 nm to 770 nm.

The constant k is defined by the relation:

                    100
         k = -------------------
             SUM( S(i) * y'(i) )

         where S(i) is the spectral <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#radiance">radiance</A> of the illuminant.
 
For standard illuminants D55, D65, D75, A, B, and C, the color matching
functions have been weighted by the relative spectral power distributions
of these illuminants in such a way that k=1.  The XENON illuminant
weighting functions have also been computed so that k=1.  However, XENON
is not a standard of the C.I.E. and refers only to the JPL 12-inch light
cannon on 13 April 1976 (see Reference 2).
 
If the user is using some other illuminant, k will have to be computed
separately.  This can easily be done with another execution of TRISTIM,
inputting the spectral <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#radiance">radiance</A> of the illuminant for the 40 radiance
values, and then taking the ratio of 100 and the Y tristimulus value.
 
"tristim" also outputs the chromaticity coordinates of the spectrum in
question.  These are related by the equations:
 
          X                  Y                  Z
    x = ----- ,        y = ----- ,        z = ----- .
        X+Y+Z              X+Y+Z              X+Y+Z
The user-supplied input spectrum (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#radiance">RADIANCE</A>) may be specified as a multiple 
of up to ten separate spectral distributions, of exactly 40 points each 
(R1,...,R400). This can represent a series of filters through which light 
passes.
 
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#radiance">RADIANCE</A> values R1,...,R40 can also be modified (for whatever reason) 
by the equation:
 
   NEW_RADIANCE(i) = Ri * <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#mult">MULT</A> + <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#add">ADD</A>

where <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#mult">MULT</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#add">ADD</A> are the values specified for the parameters of those
names.
In addition, the user may specify Continuum and Background spectra, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#contin">CONTIN</A>
and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#back">BACK</A>, which will be applied to the input spectrum according to the
following formula:

                        (Ri - <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#back">BACK</A>(i))
   NEW_RADIANCE(i) = -------------------
                     (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#contin">CONTIN</A>(i) - <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/tristim_level2.html#back">BACK</A>(i))

This can be useful to process spectrophotometric tracings of inputs in
certain colors and of a white reference input.
