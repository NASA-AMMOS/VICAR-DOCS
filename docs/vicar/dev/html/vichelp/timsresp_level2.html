<pre>
The program will report the calibration that was in effect on this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/timsresp_level2.html#date">date</A>. That
is, it will use the last calibration on or prior to this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/timsresp_level2.html#date">date</A>. The format of
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/timsresp_level2.html#date">date</A> should be a number consisting of the last two digits of the year,
the month number (as 2 digits) and the day of month. For example, May 21, 1988
would be entered as 880521.

<A NAME="adjust"><H3>ADJUST</H3></A><pre>
The spectral calibration can be adjusted by using this parameter. The
adjustments are made in 0.032 micron steps. For example, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/timsresp_level2.html#adjust">ADJUST</A>=2 will take
the sensor response reported at 10.000 microns during calibration and list it
at 10.064 microns.
