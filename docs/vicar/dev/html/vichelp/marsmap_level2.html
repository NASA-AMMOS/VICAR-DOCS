<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
There are two options for describing input images.

Either:
List the image file names

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output image containing the mosaic.

By default, the output will have the same <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands
as the input with the most bands, and all bands will be processed.  Inputs
with fewer than that many bands repeat their last <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">band</A>, so bw and color images
can be mixed.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">BAND</A> is specified, the output will have a single band.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="projection"><H3>PROJECTION</H3></A><pre>
The output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A> type. 
Options include CYLINDRICAL (the default), POLAR, VERTICAL, and SINUSOIDAL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="zoom"><H3>ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for the image.  This is a shortcut to computing and
specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A>.  A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of 2 will make the image twice
as big as it "naturally" wants to be (or twice as big as the specified
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A>/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A>).  A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> of .25 will make it one quarter the "natural"
size.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The BSQ input file <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">band</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A>. Defaults to all bands in image, but will use
a value of 1 if an invalid <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">band</A> is specified. Providing a value will cause
only that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">band</A> to be processed.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="input_range"><H3>INPUT_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The range of inputs to actually mosaic.  Normally all inputs are mosaicked.
However, if this parameter is specified, all inputs will be used to calculate
the output <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>, but only the inputs in the specified range will be
mosaicked.  This allows the generation of a large mosaic to be spread <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#out">out</A>
over several nodes on a network, with a program like FASTMOS used to combine
all the outputs together.  Note that any underlays (annotation that goes
under the image) should be put on the *last* mosaic only for FASTMOS;
overlays (that show on top of everything) should be on all images (or at
least the first).

The input numbers are 1-based.  If only one <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> is specified, it is the
starting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A>; the end defaults to the # of inputs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bias"><H3>BIAS</H3></A><pre>
Specifies values to multiply DN values of each input
picture. Defaults to 1.0 for each picture. For example, 
if there are five input images, then try
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>=(1.0, 1.33, 0.8, 1.90, 1.0)

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A> is obsolete now; it has been replaced by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="brtcorr"><H3>BRTCORR</H3></A><pre>
Specifies an input file containing brightness corrections.  This is an
XML file that comes from a program like marsbrt which contains correction
factors for each image.  These factors may be additive or multiplicative
constants to be applied to the image, or other corrections that may be
implemented in the future.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> mechanism is intended to replace <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.  Using them together
should be avoided because the labels will not reflect both (the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>
overrides).  If you do, however, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#brtcorr">BRTCORR</A> corrections are applied to
the data first, before <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bias">BIAS</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="scale"><H3>SCALE</H3></A><pre>
The output mosaic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> in pixels/degree.  Defaults to the natural scale
of the camera.  This natural <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> is printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#out">out</A> for reference.
NOTE:  This is for Cylindrical, Polar, and Sinusoidal only.  See
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A> for Vertical <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="leftaz"><H3>LEFTAZ</H3></A><pre>
Azimuth of the left edge of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
smallest azimuth of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical and Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rightaz"><H3>RIGHTAZ</H3></A><pre>
Azimuth of the right edge of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
largest azimuth of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical and Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="topel"><H3>TOPEL</H3></A><pre>
Elevation of the top of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
largest elevation of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Used for Cylindrical and Sinusoidal as well as Polar (unlike the
other az/el limits).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bottomel"><H3>BOTTOMEL</H3></A><pre>
Elevation of the bottom of the output mosaic.  Defaults to the
smallest elevation of any corner or edge-center of the input images.
Cylindrical and Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="proj_origin"><H3>PROJ_ORIGIN</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the center of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.  This is an XYZ point from which
all of the azimuth/elevation rays emanate.  It defaults to the average
of all the input camera locations.  Note that the coordinate frame used
to express this value is usually the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A> frame (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>) but can be
modified using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#po_coord">PO_COORD</A>.  This allows you to, for example, specify the
origin in a constant location relative to the rover (in rover frame, say
at the mast rotation point) while making the mosaic in site or local_level
coordinates.
Cylindrical, Polar, Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="po_coord"><H3>PO_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Coordinate frame used to specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#proj_origin">PROJ_ORIGIN</A>.  If not given, the frame
defaults to that given in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>.  This parameter is ignored unless
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#proj_origin">PROJ_ORIGIN</A> is specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="up_az"><H3>UP_AZ</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the azimuth at the top of the image.  This has the effect of
rotating the image, with the given azimuth being straight up.
Polar only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="vert_scale"><H3>VERT_SCALE</H3></A><pre>
The output mosaic <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> in meters/pixel for Vertical projections only.
(See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> for Cylindrical and Polar).  There is no "natural" default
for this parameter, so it arbitrarily defaults to .01 meters/pixel.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="minx"><H3>MINX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the minimum extent of the image in meters in the X direction
(down, or south).  The picture height is from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#minx">MINX</A> to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A>.  Defaults
to -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A> which mimics the behavior before <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#minx">MINX</A> was available.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxx"><H3>MAXX</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in the X direction
(up, or north).  The picture height is from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#minx">MINX</A> to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxx">MAXX</A>.
Defaults to 5 meters.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="miny"><H3>MINY</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the minimum extent of the image in meters in the Y direction
(down, or south).  The picture height is from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#miny">MINY</A> to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A>.  Defaults
to -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A> which mimics the behavior before <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#miny">MINY</A> was available.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxy"><H3>MAXY</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the maximum extent of the image in meters in the Y direction
(right, or east).  The picture width is from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#miny">MINY</A> to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#maxy">MAXY</A>.
Defaults to 5 meters.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="center_az"><H3>CENTER_AZ</H3></A><pre>
Azimuth of the center of the sinusoidal <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.  This is the azimuth at
which the "cusps" (where the zenith and nadir converge) appear.  Defaults
to the center of the mosaic.
Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="center_el"><H3>CENTER_EL</H3></A><pre>
Elevation of the center of the sinusoidal <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>.  This is the elevation
from which the cosine terms are measured.  So anything at this elevation will
be full-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> (just like Cylindrical).  The azimuth scale changes as a function
of the cosine of the angle between the point's elevation and the center
elevation.  In essense, this defines where the "equator" of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A> is.
Defaults to 0 degrees.
Sinusoidal only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wrap_az"><H3>WRAP_AZ</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A> is an optional argument used to define a specific wrapping location 
for a mosaic.  It is only used for a complete 360 mosaic, if the mosaic
is not full the wrap should occur where the data is missing.  Can be defined
in any coordiante system with WRAP_CS. Input in degrees.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wrap_el"><H3>WRAP_EL</H3></A><pre>
Needed for supporting the functionality of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A> in converting coordinate systems.
The default value of 0 is sufficient for the vast majority of use cases.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wrap_coord"><H3>WRAP_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Coordinate system of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A> input. This is helpful if you would like to define
a wrapping location in a coordinate system different than your other mosaic parameters.
An example of this functionality would be wrapping in the rover frame at <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#wrap_az">WRAP_AZ</A>=180
(back of the rover) to move the rover hardware to the edges of the mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid"><H3>GRID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> to use.  Valid values are:

NOGRID - No <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> is generated
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">GRID</A> - A grid is generated "underneath" the image, so it shows only where
    there is no image
GRID_OVERLAY - A <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> is generated "on top of" the image, so it shows
    everywhere.
GRID_LABELS - Plots the numbers and text only, without the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> lines.
    Useful when combined with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#input_range">INPUT_RANGE</A>.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> consists of azimuth/elevation lines (Cylindrical, Polar), or
X/Y lines (Vertical) and labels for each line along the edges (down from
the center for Polar Elevation).

The default is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">GRID</A>.

See also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid_spacing">GRID_SPACING</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid_dn">GRID_DN</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid_zoom">GRID_ZOOM</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_spacing"><H3>GRID_SPACING</H3></A><pre>

Overrides the spacing of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> lines.  Both sets of lines use the
same value (i.e. azimuth and elevation can't be different).  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">GRID</A>
keyword.

Defaults to 10 degrees for Cylindrical and Polar, and 1 meter for Vertical.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_dn"><H3>GRID_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> and grid labels.  See GRID keyword.  Note, a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid_dn">GRID_DN</A> of 0 is transparent (i.e. ignored).  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of DN's supplied
is less than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands, the last value is repeated as necessary.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="grid_zoom"><H3>GRID_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor to use for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">grid</A> labels (i.e. how big the text is).
Must be a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#grid">GRID</A> keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#radius">radius</A>.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.    

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the

is used, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface = PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters.  For the cases when PLANE 
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection 
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, 
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same. Last, MESH is a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
model defined by a mesh file (.obj) which path is given with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_mesh">SURF_MESH</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="surf_mesh"><H3>SURF_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Mesh OBJ file to use as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model. For the mesh to be used,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> must be set to MESH. The coordinates of the mesh vertices can be 
expressed in any CS. However the mesh CS must be supplied via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A>.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> is not used, then the mesh is assumed to be to the CS that
results from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>

doesn't have to). But <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> could be use to define a CS in which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A>

<hr>
<A NAME="number"><H3>NUMBER</H3></A><pre>
Causes the program to place an ASCII <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> into the mosaic at the center of
where each input picture falls.  Numbers begin at 1 and increase in the
order of the filenames in the input.  This permits one to determine which
picture populated which part of the mosaic.  Defaults to NONUMBER.

The DN to use for the numbers is set by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number_dn">NUMBER_DN</A>, and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor for
the numbers by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number_zoom">NUMBER_ZOOM</A>.

Normally numbers are written in order, 1 to n (or, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number_start">NUMBER_START</A> to n).
However, this is not quite right per the stacking order, which puts the
first on top.  If multiple images stack, -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> will show the highest
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> while the imagery is from the lowest.

This is fixed by -INV_NUMBER.  Specifying -INV_NUMBER is the same as -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A>
except they're plotted in the opposite order... bottom to top.  The result
is the top image "wins", just as with the mosaic.  In a perfect world, this
would be the default, but there's enough history with the current behavior
of -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> to be hesitant to change it.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_dn"><H3>NUMBER_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the image numbers.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> keyword.  Note, a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number_dn">NUMBER_DN</A> of 0 is transparent (i.e. ignored).  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of DN's supplied
is less than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands, the last value is repeated as necessary.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_zoom"><H3>NUMBER_ZOOM</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#zoom">zoom</A> factor to use for the image numbers (i.e. how big the numbers are).
Must be a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="number_start"><H3>NUMBER_START</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the starting point for the image numbers (i.e. the first input is
assigned this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> for the image number overlays, and they increment from
there).  Normally this will be 1, but could be set differently if only part
of a larger mosaic is being generated.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="footprt"><H3>FOOTPRT</H3></A><pre>
Causes "footprints" to be drawn around each input image in the output
mosaic.  This is useful to show overlap of the images, and is often used
in conjunction with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A>.

There are three values:

NOFOOTPRINT - No footprint is displayed.  This is the default.
FOOTPRINT - Shows the footprint only where the edge of the image is "on top".
    Useful to see which image is laid down first.  If the DN (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>) has
    insufficient contrast, the footprint may not be very visible, since it
    is interpolated like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A> pixels.
OVERLAP - shows the entire footprints of all images, even if another image
    overlaps the edge of the input.  Useful to see how much overlap there is
    between images.  OVERLAP <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> will slow down the program down somewhat,
    since the borders are drawn in after the mosaic is created (to ensure that
    all borders are drawn).

The DN to use for the footprints is set by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A>.  Note that the footprint
replaces (hides) the outer row of pixels in the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="foot_dn"><H3>FOOT_DN</H3></A><pre>
The DN to use for the footprints.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#footprt">FOOTPRT</A> keyword.  Note, a
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#foot_dn">FOOT_DN</A> of 0 is transparent (i.e. ignored).  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of DN's supplied
is less than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands, the last value is repeated as necessary.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_foot"><H3>MAX_FOOT</H3></A><pre>
Normally, if footprints or image numbers are turned on, all images will
get them.  This parameter allows you to specify a maximum image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> for
footprints and numbers.  Any images beyond this image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> will not get
footprints or image numbers.  This can be useful if you want to include
"background" images in the mosaic that are not numbered (such as for a
finder chart).  Just put those images at the back of the file list.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tau"><H3>TAU</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tau">Tau</A> is a measure of atmospheric opacity.  The default for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A> Mars conditions
is 0.6. Higher <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tau">tau</A> means more dust in the atmosphere.

<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="rad"><H3>RAD</H3></A><pre>
Keyword paramter that selects radiometric correction <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> of the input images.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rad">RAD</A> (the default) enables the correction (for missions/instruments which support
it); NORAD disables it; ZENITH_SCALED_RAD the radiometry you'd get if the sun
were at zenith on a clear day.  The scaling factor is a combination of solar
elevation and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tau">tau</A>, and will have the effect of brightening up images that
were taken near sunset.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale"><H3>DNSCALE</H3></A><pre>
DN scaling factor.  This factor is used to convert between physical
radiometric units (watts/(meter**2, steradian, micron)) and DN's for the
output mosaic.  The formula is:

true_radiance = offset + (factor * DN)

where "offset" is 0.0 in the current implementation, and "factor" is
1.0 / <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A> (making the formula equivalently:  offset + (DN / DNSCALE)).
The offset and factor (1.0/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A>) are written to the output mosaic label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale_in"><H3>DNSCALE_IN</H3></A><pre>
Three-state keyword parameter to control whether or not to apply scaling
parameters to reconstruct floating point values.

RESCALE says to do the conversion, and reconstitute the float based on the
RADIANCE_* keywords.  Note that if there are no RADIANCE_* keywords,
this is a no-op, so it doesn't hurt to turn this on for non-scaled images.

NOSCALE says to not to the conversion.  This is what we do now.  If your
inputs are dynamically scaled, you'll probably get surprising results.

AUTOSCALE says to figure it <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#out">out</A> based on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> parameter (see
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> for details) and -ZENITH_SCALED_RAD flag. If DNSCALE_OUT is STATIC,
then it is NOSCALE; if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale_out">DNSCALE_OUT</A> is DYNAMIC/IDENTIT or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rad">RAD</A>=ZENITH_SCALED_RAD,
then it is RESCALE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dnscale_out"><H3>DNSCALE_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Three-state keywork parameter to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> output DN values.

If -STATIC is enabled, then the value specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#dnscale">DNSCALE</A> will be used
as the DN scaling factor (note the unit scaling factor as well) for all
radiometric models supplied.

If -DYNAMIC is enabled, then the maximum responsivity value across all
radiometric models will be used as the DN scaling factor (note the unit
scaling factor as well).

If -IDENTITY is enabled, then no scaling will be applied.

<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

Values useful to marsmap:

BORDER_LEFT:  Specifies, in pixels, a border to cut off on the left side of
  each input image.  This can be used to eliminate edge effects in input images.
BORDER_RIGHT:  Same but for the right side.
BORDER_TOP:  Same but for the top edge.
BORDER_BOTTOM:  Same but for the bottom edge.

New ones (as of 2012/10/26) not mentioned elsewhere:

RMC_MAX_INDEX: Specifies the max # of indices to use when comparing RMC's.
  Effectively makes the RMC only this long.  Useful to ignore pose changes
  due to IMU jitter, or when using the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> file.  Default is 10.
RMC_EPSILON: Epsilon value for comparison of coordinate system values.  Even
  if the RMC's match, a new CS is created if the values differ by more than
  this epsilon.  Setting it high means more CS's will considered equal.
  Default: 1e-3
MARGIN_LEFT:  Like BORDER_LEFT, but the margin is scaled based on the
  downsample factor of the image.  So if the margin is needed to hide CCD
  defects, the same area of the CCD will be cut off regardless of downsampling.
MARGIN_RIGHT, MARGIN_TOP, MARGIN_BOTTOM:  Same as above.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
MARSMAP can operate in one of two modes.  The first is the traditional
method (INCREMENTAL), where each line is written to the mosaic output
file as it is processed.  The second (MEMORY) is the default; it stores
the entire mosaic in memory and writes it to the file only when it is
complete.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="interp"><H3>INTERP</H3></A><pre>
Keyword parameter that turns on or off interpolation of the output
images pixel values.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#interp">INTERP</A> (the default) enables the interpolation, 
while NOINTERP disables it.

MEMORY <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> (the default) is somewhat faster (perhaps 10%, although
that's highly variable), and is required if doing parallel processing.
However, the memory requirements could become prohibitive for large
mosaics.

INCREMENTAL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is slower, but has the advantage of being able to view
the mosaic as it is being generated.  An image viewer such as xvd can be
used to monitor the progress of the mosaic.  By reloading periodically,
one can do quality control while a long mosaic is in progress.  Also,
the memory requirements are drastically lower in this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fov_limit"><H3>FOV_LIMIT</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the default limits (89.4, 30) on size of the FOV for the input
image.  The FOV really affects how far away from the pointing vector we can
be before we say nope, this image doesn't apply.  The actual FOV is calculated,
but these limits exist as sanity checks.  Note that the limit is input in
degrees, with the larger value first.  If either limit is specified, both
must be.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="reverse"><H3>REVERSE</H3></A><pre>
If -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#reverse">REVERSE</A> is turned on, the program will stack the outputs in reverse
order, with last on top instead of first on top.  This is implemented
inefficiently in that we still go through the list in top-down order, but
we just don't stop once a pixel is found.  So every input that overlaps is
mosaicked to the output, and the last one survives.  Note that this is
exactly what OVR does, but intentionally rather than as a side effect.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing using OMP, which uses multiple cores on
a single host machine.  The default is on.  The main help describes some
environment variables that can further control parallel processing.  Note
that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built in to the gcc/g+ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP documentation.

<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for all input parameters and output values,
and the mosaic itself.  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_name"><H3>FIXED_NAME</H3></A><pre>
Overrides what CS type is
allowed for the FIXED frame

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_name"><H3>FIXED_NAME</H3></A><pre>
Overrides what CS type is allowed for the fixed frame.  Normally this is the
lowest-numbered SITE_FRAME.  However, the PIG library actually looks for any
CS with only one index as a potential fixed frame.  This causes issues with
the M20 helicopter, where e.g. the HELI_G_FRAME also has only one index.  This
parameter allows the user to force the fixed frame to SITE_FRAME.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system. These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tiepoints"><H3>TIEPOINTS</H3></A><pre>
Input tiepoint file for tiepoint visualization.  Only used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tie_type">TIE_TYPE</A>
is turned on.  Both the old (text) and new (XML) tiepoint file formats
are supported, and the format is auto-detected.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tie_type"><H3>TIE_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Allows <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> to be visualized by plotting them on top of a mosaic.
Should never be used for production mosaics; this is intended to help
determine if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> (such as from MARSAUTOTIE) are any good.

The default value, NO_TIES, turns off tiepoint visualization completely.

POINTS turns on point <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.  The left side of the tiepoint is indicated
by a dot (single pixel) on the image at the location that point projects to.
The value of the pixel is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tie_dn">TIE_DN</A> plus 10 times the difference (in mosaic
space) between the left and right parts of the tiepoint.  This gives some
indication of how well the tiepoint was corrected.  Thus if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tie_dn">TIE_DN</A> is 7000,
a value of 7032 indicates that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tiepoints">tiepoints</A> were 3.2 pixels apart.  Of
course, a difference of 0 (dn=7000 for this example) means that the tiepoint
was corrected perfectly.

FLAG does what POINTS does, but then draws an additional vector on the
image (at half the intensity of the point).  This vector starts at the point
and continues for 10 pixels parallel to a line between the centers of the
"left" and "right" images for that tiepoint.  Thus it provides some indication
of which pair of images was involved in the tiepoint, when there are multiple
overlapping images.  Note that the edge of the mosaic is not considered; if
the image centers are on opposite ends of the mosaic (as in, the edge of the
mosaic splits the centers), the vector will use the actual centers, without
being adjusted for wrapping.

VECTOR does what POINTS does, but then draws an additional vector on the
image (at half the intensity of the point).  This vector starts at the point
and continues in the direction of the right-side tiepoint.  The length of the
vector is 10 times the difference between the left and right (same as the
intensity of the point itself).  This makes it easy to visualize tiepoint
outliers.  TRUE_VECTOR acts the same but without the 10x length modification
(so the endpoints lay exactly where the two parts of the tiepoint project to).

Tiepoint visualization is especially effective when combined with -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">NUMBER</A> and
-OVER (overlapping footprints).  The -FLAG or -VECTOR modes should almost
always be used; POINT alone has not proved to be useful.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="tie_dn"><H3>TIE_DN</H3></A><pre>
DN value to use for tiepoint visualization.  See <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#tie_type">TIE_TYPE</A>.  If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A>
of DN's supplied is less than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of bands, the last value is repeated
as necessary.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="horizon"><H3>HORIZON</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a cutoff elevation above which no output is generated.  This is
generally useful only in overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.  In overlap mode, this provides a way
to eliminate the sky from consideration when determining brightness statistics
for the overlaps.  This can be helpful when (as is often the case) the sky
exhibits different radiometry than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">ground</A>.  Cutting off the sky better
matches the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">ground</A> in these cases.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#horizon">HORIZON</A> is only active for cylindrical and polar projections.  It is ignored
for vertical.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ovr_out"><H3>OVR_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Turns on overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, and specifies the output overlap file.  Overlap mode
computes statistics for the overlapping areas in the mosaic, and outputs a
file containing those statistics.  This file can then be used by "marsbrt"
to compute a correction.

This overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> replaces the functionality of the old "marsint" program.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_open"><H3>MAX_OPEN</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of images for each pass.  Normally this is 20 (or the
maximum for overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>).  Generally this will not need to be adjusted, but
if the last pass has only one or two images, you may get better throughput
by increasing this parameter slightly.  Each pass has an overhead, so if memory
is sufficient, a large value can also increase throughput.

In overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, all images must fit into memory; therefore <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#max_open">MAX_OPEN</A> needs to
be at least as big as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of input images.

The default is 20 for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, and the maximum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> of images for
overlap <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="start_key"><H3>START_KEY</H3></A><pre>
Starting key <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#number">number</A> for the output overlap file.  Overlap files contain a
list of images, each of which is associated with an integer key.  Setting
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#start_key">START_KEY</A> to some value allows overlap files to be merged easily, without the
keys conflicting.  It is acceptable to have the same image in different
sections of a merged file (with different keys); they are properly merged
when read in.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="radius"><H3>RADIUS</H3></A><pre>

Specifies the maximum size of overlap areas.  0 means no maximum.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="which_ovr"><H3>WHICH_OVR</H3></A><pre>
Specifies whether to create <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#normal">normal</A> overlaps, overall "overlaps" (whole-image
statistics), or both.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="use_hsi"><H3>USE_HSI</H3></A><pre>
Turns on HSI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#mode">mode</A> for overlaps.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="idx_out"><H3>IDX_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the index file.

The index file contains, for each pixel, a halfword integer (16 bit signed)
identifying which image the pixel came from.  0 indicates no value (black
in the mosaic).  Numbers from 1-n match the order of files in the input list
file (or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#inp">INP</A> parameter, if a list file isn't given).  For most mosaics, the
file could be converted to byte using CFORM (half is used to support more
than 255 input files).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="icm_out"><H3>ICM_OUT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the (optional) output filename for the ICM file.

The ICM file is an Image Coregistration Map.  It is a two-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#band">band</A> float file
containing the line, sample coordinate of the input pixel used for the point.
This is the same basic format as correlation maps such as MARSCOR3 produces,
except that multiple images are involved (thus the need for the index file,
in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#idx_out">IDX_OUT</A>).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bar"><H3>BAR</H3></A><pre>
Turns on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A>.  The scale bar is by default plotted in the lower left
corner (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar_pos">BAR_POS</A>).  The nominal size of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> (really the minimum size)
in pixels is given by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar_size">BAR_SIZE</A>.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> size will be increased as necessary
to achieve round units.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> size is constrained to be 1, 2, 5, or 10 per
decade, and units are nm, um, mm, cm, m, and km (units are plotted in upper
case, however).  So the possible <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> sizes are quantized, for example sizes
can be:

..., 0.01NM, 0.02NM, 0.05NM, 0.1NM, 0.2NM, 0.5NM,
1nm, 2nm, 5nm, 10nm, 20nm, 50nm, 100nm, 200nm, 500nm
1um, 2um, 5um, 10um, 20um, 50um, 100um, 200um, 500um
1mm, 2mm, 5mm,
1cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 50cm,
1m, 2m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 50m, 100m, 200m, 500m,
1km, 2km, 5km, 10km, ...

A critical factor in proper <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> size is the range.  The meters per
pixel is determined by range / <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> where scale is the pixels/degree
(converted to pixels/radian) from the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A> parameter or as determined by
the input camera model.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> is correct for the mosaic, so the
accuracy of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> depends on the range.

Normally range is computed by projecting to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model.  However, this
can be quite inaccurate if the actual <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#ground">ground</A> does not match the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model.
For that reason, it is recommended that the range be supplied (via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar_range">BAR_RANGE</A>)
when possible.  This may come from an XYZ image, or (for example for MSL
ChemCam or M20 SuperCam RMI) from the known focus distance.

If the range is not computable for a given point (for example it projects
above the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model), or if it would plot off the edge of the image,
the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A> is suppressed.

For Vertical <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#projection">projection</A>, the meters per pixel is not range dependant, it
is simply the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#vert_scale">VERT_SCALE</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="bar_pos"><H3>BAR_POS</H3></A><pre>
Sets location for the center of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A>.  This is also the point at
which the range is computed.  The values are in the order (line, sample).

If either line or sample is negative, it is treated as an offset up from
the bottom, or in from the right edge of the mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bar_size"><H3>BAR_SIZE</H3></A><pre>
Sets overall desired size of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#scale">scale</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A>, in pixels.  This is actually the
minimum size for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">bar</A>; it will likely be somewhat bigger than this in
order to achieve a round dimension.  See the help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsmap_level2.html#bar">BAR</A>.

Normally the text (as with
all overlay text in marsmap) is 7 pixels high.  Although fractional zooms
are allowed, they may create undesirable aliasing in the output.
