PURPOSE:
       
   FITSOUT is a VICAR*2 Applications program to convert a VICAR*2
image file into FITS formatted data sets.

OPERATION:

	Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) tapes are a general interchange
data format used by radio and optical astronomy observatories for passing
multidimensional and tabular data.  The format consists of fixed length
records of 2880 bytes or integer multiples of 2880 bytes. There is at least 
one <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">block</A> of ASCII information that preceeds the binary (data) 
information. The fixed length record of 2880 bytes was chosen because it is 
divisible by the word lengths of the most common computer systems. The data 
records from the instrument are packed into these fixed length records after
the FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A>.

	FITSOUT creates a standard FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">block</A> of 2880 bytes by
extracting certain information from the VICAR system label.  It will optionally
transfer VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">history</A> information to FITS with the HISTORY parmameter.
The entire <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">block</A> is printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#out">out</A> on the log.

	No provision has been made to create FITS tapes with ANSI standard
labels.  If you were to create one with the VICAR MOUNT command then 
the FITS images will be file numbers 2, 5, 8, 11,... on the
tape. File numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc will be ANSI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> records. Note not
all facilities are able to read FITS with ANSI labels directly. Please
indicate ANSI labels if you are passing such a tape to another facility.


FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">HEADER</A> 

	Each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">block</A> consists of 36 80-byte records (card images).
The first 10 columns of each card image contains an 8-character keyword
followed by a blank and an equals sign. Columns 11 through 30 contain a
value or string in ASCII characters which is right-justified. Columns 31
through 80 are a comment field. The first character of a comment field
(column 31) is a slash, /.

	The first FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> record at a minimum consists of the following
information:
	The first card contains "SIMPLE    =" in columns 1 through 10  
followed by a logical "T" or "F" in column 30. "T" indicates that the
tape format follows the basic rules of FITS format. "F" implies that
it does not.
	The second card contains "BITPIX    =" which gives the number of bits
per pixel in each data record.  The valid values are 8, 16 and 32. All
axes of data must have the same number of bits per pixel.
	The third card contains "NAXIS     =" which gives the number of
dimensions (axes) of the data.  fitsout currently only processes three
dimensions or less.  When a sample tape of four or more dimensions is
received then it should be possible to convert the data to IBIS tabular
files although the current program does not do this.
	The fourth and subsequent cards (up to the number of dimensions)
contain "NAXIS1    =", "NAXIS2     =", "NAXIS3    =",...,"NAXISn    ="
which define the number of pixels along each dimension, n.
	Any number of optional <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> cards may follow.
	The last card is always the "END" card.

For example, the simplest FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> sequence would look like:

	'         111111111122222222223'  &lt--card column number
	'123456789012345678901234567890'	
	'SIMPLE   =               T'		!LOGICAL
	'BITPIX   =              16'		!INTEGER
	'NAXIS    =               2'		!INTEGER
	'NAXIS1   =             512'		!INTEGER
	'NAXIS2   =             512'		!INTEGER
	'END                       '

	FITS allows many optional <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> cards.  These optional header cards
vary from one sensor to another and one observatory to another. Some of 
the more important ones, as far as FITSOUT is concerned, are BZERO, BSCALE,
BUNIT, OBJECT, DATE, DATAMAX, DATAMIN, COMMENT, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">HISTORY</A>, and BLANK.

CONVERSION OF VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">HISTORY</A> LABELS INTO FITS HEADERS

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">HISTORY</A>   'VICAR LABEL LISTING'
VIC-TASK= 'STARCAT - 13-AUG-1990 04:03'
VIC-ITEM= '			'

                                                                       
Many of the FITS labels have strings in them. By convention a string
begins with a single quote (') and ends with another single quote. VICAR
however, stores strings with double quotes ("). FITSOUT converts all VICAR
double quote strings to FITS single quotes .
For example, VICAR label of:

COMMENT="PLANET SATURN - VOYAGER 2 - SEPT 20, 1981"

This would be converted into the FITS label item

VIC-ITEM= 'PLANET SATURN - VOYAGER 2 - SEPT 20, 1981'       

FITS EXTENSIONS

	FITS extensions are not yet supported.  The current recognized
extensions are 'TABLE', '3DTABLE', and 'A3DTABLE'. They will be incorporated
as soon as examples are received.

FITS DATA

	Data on fits tape are packed into 2880 byte fixed length records
or integer multiples of 2880-byte fixed length records.
The label items BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1, NAXIS2, ..., NAXISn describe how
the data is packed. BITPIX which indicates the number of bits per pixel,
can take on the values 8 (BYTE), 16 (HALF WORD), 32 (FULL WORD) and -32 
(IEEE single precision REAL). IEEE double precision,
BITPIX = -64, is not supported in this program. NAXIS tells how many
dimensions the data has. FITSOUT in its current implementation can
process only NAXIS values of 1, 2 and 3. NAXIS1, NAXIS2 and NAXIS3 give
the number of pixels per axis (sample, line, band) in VICAR nomenclature.


PARAMETERS

	The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=filename parameter is not required.  If not given then
only the VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#inp">INP</A>= file is scanned and converted to FITS header
which are printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#out">out</A> to the terminal and/or session log. The scan will
list the number and content of all FITS keywords to be created.

	The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">HEADER</A>= parameter is not required. It saves the created
FITS label in a file which has 80 byte fixed length records. No output 
FITS data is created. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">HISTORY</A>=NOHISTORY parameter will exclude VICAR
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">history</A> information from this file.  The HISTORY=TASKS will list the VICAR
tasks, the username and the time and date that the task was run.

	The parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#outdata">OUTDATA</A>="VICAR"/"SCALE8"/"SCALE16"/"8"/"16"/"32"/"-32"
refers to the number of bits per pixel to pass to the output FITS image.
The default is VICAR format which means that it will pass to the output
image the same data format that is stored in the VICAR image according to
the following table. 

		VICAR		FITS

		BYTE		BITPIX=8	unsigned
		HALF		BITPIX=16	signed
		WORD		BITPIX=32	signed
		FULL		BITPIX=32 	(older VICAR specifier)
		REAL		BITPIX=-32
		DOUBLE		BITPIX=-64	not supported yet
		COMPLEX		BITPIX=-33	-33 is internal to FITSOUT
		COMP		BITPIX=-33	(older VICAR specifier)

For example, If the VICAR data is 'BYTE' then the output will be FITS
"BITPIX = 8".  In this case it will enter into the resultant FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A>
the value of BSCALE = 1.0 and BZERO = 0.0.  Note that VICAR real data sets are
converted from VAX F Floating Point Format (real*4) data into IEEE
floating point format.

If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#outdata">OUTDATA</A>="SCALE8" then FITSOUT will transform the VICAR data into FITS
"BITPIX = 8" with appropriate BSCALE = and BZERO = values.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#outdata">OUTDATA</A>="SCALE16"
then FITSOUT will convert the VICAR data into FITS "BITPIX = 16" with
appropriate BSCALE and BZERO values.


			REAL = (FITS*BSCALE)+BZERO
where,

REAL is the R*4 output value in the VICAR image,
FITS is the FITS stored data value in 8 bit, 16 bit or 32 bit format,
BSCALE is the value stored in the FITS BSCALE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> record,
BZERO is the value stored in the FITS BZERO <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> record.
					
If no BSCALE or BZERO values are found in the label when you give this option
then fitsout will warn you and then use default values of BSCALE=1.0 and
BZERO=0.0 to do the conversion. Thus, use of the "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#outdata">OUTDATA</A>=REAL" option will
force the output to be 'REAL' no matter what format the VICAR data is in.

The parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#factor">FACTOR</A> control the physical length of the records
recorded on tape and disk. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A> is a keyword that can have the values
"<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#block">BLOCK</A>" or "NOBLOCK", with the default being NOBLOCK.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#factor">FACTOR</A> tells the
number of logical records to pack into each physical record on a tape. As
such it must be an integer.  It's maximum value is 10, the FITS standard
maximum value.  Not all FITS sites can read blocked tapes. 

The other parameter is geared toward limiting the number of FITS headers.

	<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">HISTORY</A>="HISTORY"/"TASKS"/"NOHISTORY" - Pass all History/Pass only
	Tasks/Don't Pass VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">history</A> labels to the FITS <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A>.
	By default, all VICAR <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#history">history</A> labels are passed.
	
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#debug">DEBUG</A> parameter allows the printing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#out">out</A> of certain information as the
program executes.

LIMITATIONS

	1. The program has not been implemented for multi-dimensional files
	   greater than 3 dimensions.
	2. Changes  (double quotes) in VICAR labels to  (single quote)
	   in FITS labels.
	3. Does not support IEEE double precision output (BITPIX = -64)
	4. Does not allow use of FITS extensions yet.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/fitsout_level2.html#header">header</A> record
	   is included for future use.
	5. ANSII standard labels are not supported yet.
	6. Does not work with VICAR data sets of type COMPLEX or COMP.
	7. Works only in BSQ mode for NAXIS=3.
	8. Multivolume tapes not supported.
	9. Only works with image data sets (not TABLULAR or GRAPHICS)
	10. Does not transfer VICAR "property" labels yet
	11. Truncates VICAR keywords to 8 characters in transfer to FITS
	12. Multidimensional files must be generated in VICAR since this
	    program allows for only one input file.
