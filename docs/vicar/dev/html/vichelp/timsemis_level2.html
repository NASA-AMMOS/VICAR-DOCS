The file containing all six bands of a calibrated TIMS image, using the
WATTS units.

     The first output dataset is a halfword image of all six bands of TIMS
emittance data, scaled such that an emittance of 1.0 is 10,000 DN.
     The second output dataset is a halfword temperature image, where each DN
corresponds to 0.01 degree Celsius. 0 DN corresponds to 0 degrees C.

	The channel to which the other bands are to be referenced, in
	the case of REFCHAN mode, is input through this parameter.
	The default is band six is used. In the BBFIT mode, this parameter
        is ignored.

<A NAME="date"><H3>DATE</H3></A><pre>
	TIMSEMIS uses the date of data acquisition to determine the proper
	calibration coefficients.  If defaulted, the date in the VICAR 
	label is used. This parameter is needed only if the VICAR label
	is incorrect, or if an abnormal calibration set is to be used.

<A NAME="e"><H3>E</H3></A><pre>
     In the REFCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the reference channel is
set to a constant value, given by this parameter.
     In the BBFIT mode, spectral emittances are computed so that the maximum
of the six emittance values is equal to the value of E.
     In the TWOCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the two channels with the

     Two algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first method,
called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified constant
emittance value. The default sets Channel 6 to 0.95. The temperature is computed
based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference channel, then the 
other five spectral emittances are computed, using this temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the six spectral
emittances, based upon the computed temperature.

dataset. BIL (the default) and BSQ are supported.
