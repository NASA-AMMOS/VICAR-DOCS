<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
There are two options for describing input images. 

Either:
List the image file names 

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output tiepoint table.
This is an ASCII table with a header, a record indicating the number of
tiepoints, then a series of records, one per tiepoint.  Values in the record
are:
laft_image, right_image, left_sample, left_line, right_sample, right_line,
corrected_sample, corrected_line, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#quality">quality</A>, interactive_flag

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

<p>
<p></pre>

<A NAME="band"><H3>BAND</H3></A><pre>
The vicar image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#band">band</A> number. Defaults to 1

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="template"><H3>TEMPLATE</H3></A><pre>
Correlation size. Must be an odd number. Defaults to 15 square.

Window can be specified via a single value, which applies to both line
and sample directions.  Or, it may be specified as a pair: (line,samp),
in order to define a rectangular window.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="search"><H3>SEARCH</H3></A><pre>
Initial correlation <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#search">search</A> area. Must be an odd number. Defaults to 199 square.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="density"><H3>DENSITY</H3></A><pre>
Controls how many tiepoints to keep per image pair, based on the size of the
area covered by the tiepoints.  See "Geometric scatter of points".  The
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#density">density</A> is optionally adjusted by the ratio between the nominal and actual
heights of the image (see <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#nominal_height">NOMINAL_HEIGHT</A>).

scatter of points".

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="param_win"><H3>PARAM_WIN</H3></A><pre>
Window size for parameter filtering.  See "Filter tiepoints based on
correlator parameters".

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="param_sigma"><H3>PARAM_SIGMA</H3></A><pre>
The value must be within this many sigmas during parameter filtering.  See
"Filter tiepoints based on correlator parameters".

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="param_min"><H3>PARAM_MIN</H3></A><pre>

not used and the point is passed.  See "Filter tiepoints based on correlator
parameters".

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="param_abs"><H3>PARAM_ABS</H3></A><pre>

"Filter tiepoints based on correlator parameters".

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug"><H3>DEBUG</H3></A><pre>
Flag to enable <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#debug">debug</A> prints and files.  See the "TUNING" section in the
main help.

0 == no <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#debug">debug</A>
1 == info about window sizes, culling
2 == 1 + info about tiepoints and param filtering
3 == 2 + saving intermediate (temp) images (don't do w/more than 1 or 2 pairs!)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="start_key"><H3>START_KEY</H3></A><pre>
Starting key number for the tiepoint file (XML <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#format">format</A> only).  Tiepoint files
contain a list of images, each of which is associated with an integer key.
Setting <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#start_key">START_KEY</A> to some value allows tiepoint files to be merged easily,
without the keys conflicting.  It is acceptable to have the same image in
different sections of a merged file (with different keys); they are properly
merged when read in.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="format"><H3>FORMAT</H3></A><pre>
There are two tiepoint file formats: "old" is the simple text-based list,
as used for most of MER, while "xml" is an XML-based <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#format">format</A> that supports
additional tiepoint types.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#format">FORMAT</A> parameter controls which one to use.
Over time the use of "old" should be phased <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#out">out</A> and eventually the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#format">FORMAT</A>
parameter will disappear.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nominal_height"><H3>NOMINAL_HEIGHT</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the nominal height of an input image.  If specified, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#grid_spacing">GRID_SPACING</A>
and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#density">DENSITY</A> parameters are assumed to apply to an image of this height.  The
parameters are then scaled based on the actual image height.  This allows the
grid spacing and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#density">density</A> to have similar effect across the inputs, when the
input images are at different resolutions.  For example, when including a
thumbnail image, a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#density">density</A> setting that would produce 3 tiepoints along the
edge of a nominally-sized image will still produce 3 tiepoints on the thumbnail.

The parameter is option, but highly recommended when mixing resolutions.
Without this, the grid spacing might be larger than an entire thumbnail.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="refimage"><H3>REFIMAGE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which image (if any) are reference images.

Reference images are not tiepointed to each other.  They are tiepointed to
non-reference images.  The use case is where you have a mosaic that has already
been tiepointed that is being used as a control network for a new mosaic of the
same area.  These frames will be set to references when running marsnav/marsnav2
meaning they will not be adjusted.  Because they won't be adjusted, there is
no point in collecting tiepoints between them.  Although these tiepoints don't
hurt per se, they do take time to compute and file space to manage.  So turning
them off is more efficient.  We do tie reference to non-reference images as
this is needed for them to work as a control network.

If a number in the list is negative, it means all images from the previous
number through (the absolute value of) this one will be references.  For
example a list:

1,3,-6,8,11,-15

will cause the following images to be reference images:

1,2,4,5,6,8,11,12,13,14,15

Numbering of images starts at 1.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fov"><H3>FOV</H3></A><pre>
Overrides the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#fov">FOV</A> limit for projection.  Normally this is the H + V FOV of the
camera, but limited to the range 30-90 degrees.  This parameter overrides that
value (after the limits, so it can be anything).  The projected vector has to
be within this of the center projection of the camera.  Currently A is used as
a proxy for this, which causes issues with some camera models where A through C
does not project to the middle of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing.  The default is on.  The main help
describes some environment variables that can further control parallel
processing.  Note that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built in
to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP
documentation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="normal"><H3>NORMAL</H3></A><pre>
The local mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">normal</A> vector coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> 
parameter (defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">normal</A>'s first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">normal</A>=(R, 0, 0).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ground"><H3>GROUND</H3></A><pre>
Any point on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>, in coordinate system specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> parameter
(defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">ground</A>)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">ground</A> is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> models, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_coord"><H3>SURF_COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> parameters like <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> are defined in.
For valid values refer to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> value.  For 
example <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A>=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A> should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surface"><H3>SURFACE</H3></A><pre>
The type of mars <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#out">out</A> parallax between the
stereo cameras. The two options are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=INFINITY which means no surface
is used or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=PLANE (the default case). If surface=PLANE then the plane
is defined by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> parameters. For the cases when PLANE
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
models: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> intersection
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>,
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same. Last, MESH is a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A>
model defined by a mesh file (.obj) which path is given with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_mesh">SURF_MESH</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="surf_mesh"><H3>SURF_MESH</H3></A><pre>
Mesh OBJ file to use as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> model. For the mesh to be used,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> must be set to MESH. The coordinates of the mesh vertices can be 
expressed in any CS. However the mesh CS must be supplied via <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A>.
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> is not used, then the mesh is assumed to be to the CS that
results from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>

VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> 
File name of a vicar file whose CS (contained in the labels) will be read and
assigned to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">SURFACE</A> model. The type of image and its content are of no
interest, we are just reading the CS. That CS will supersede any other <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> 
CS definition (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_coord">SURF_COORD</A>). Its typical use is to supply a CS to a
given mesh file (expectedly the XYZ from which the mesh is computed from, but
doesn't have to). But <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surf_csfile">SURF_CSFILE</A> could be use to define a CS in which <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#normal">NORMAL</A> 
and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#ground">GROUND</A> for a PLANE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">surface</A> are expressed in.

<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#search">search</A> is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#format">format</A>.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstie.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstie.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#surface">Surface</A> Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/marsautotie_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.
