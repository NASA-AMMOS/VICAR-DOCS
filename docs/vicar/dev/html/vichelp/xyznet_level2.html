<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
An ascii list of filenames of stereo pair images to be displayed. 
The images can be in any order. It is assumed that filenames look something
like this:  i1246928651l.img_0069063120
where the l.img means left eye. Similarly r.img means right eye. Stereo pairs
have the same number between the initial i and the l.img or r.img .

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
An ascii list of tiepoints between all of the input stereo pairs of images.
The format is one tiepoint/record and the data is:

x y z left_filename left_sample left_line right_filename right_sample 
right_line

x, y, and z are in Mars coordinates with the x axis pointing north, y pointing
east, and z pointing down.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="percent"><H3>PERCENT</H3></A><pre>
Image histogram saturation at each end.
Each input image is autostretched before being displayed.
Default is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#percent">percent</A>=2.0

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="device"><H3>DEVICE</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#device">Device</A> type to plot or display to. Options are:
/XTERM,  tektronix terminal
/XWINDOW workstations running x windows
/XSERVE, persistent X window
/XMOTIF  X motif
The default is: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#device">device</A>=/XSERVE

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="archive"><H3>ARCHIVE</H3></A><pre>
The name of the optional xyz data <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#archive">archive</A>.
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#archive">archive</A> is formatted the same as the output file and contains all known 
surveyed xyz points. These points will be displayed in the images 
as white symbols to facilitate understanding what areas have already 
been surveyed. You can concatenate the output file with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#archive">archive</A> to 
make it grow.
Default name is "data_archive".

<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by xyznet.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by xyznet.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/xyznet_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.
