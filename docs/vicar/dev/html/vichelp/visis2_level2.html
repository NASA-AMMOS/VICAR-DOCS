<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
1-10 Input file(s), depending the program mode:

(A) VICAR-to-ISIS mode:

The inputs are VICAR files which are combined into a single NIMS ISIS cube 
file output.  In this case, the input files are, in order:

	1) one 2DHIST file (created by program HIST2D),
	2) 0-6 SPECPLOT files (created by program SPECPLOT), 
	3) one merged mosaic cube file (created by program NIMSCMM2),
	4) one co-cube file, (created by program NIMSCMM2),
	5) optionally, one Spectral Index Image cube file 

Items 1, 3, and 4 are required;  the SPECPLOT files and SII cube may be
omitted.

Note that VISIS2 checks the labels of the inputs (except for #5) for the 
program that created it, and aborts the job if the correct one is not found.
(This is necessary in order to identify the various inputs.)  If for some 
reason the proper task name is not in the label of one of the inputs, the 
user will have to add it manually.  However, for items 3 and 4, parameter 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visis2_level2.html#taskname">TASKNAME</A> can be used to change the task searched for.  (See Help TASKNAME.)

(B) ISIS-to-VICAR mode:

There is only one input file, the ISIS cube file.  The outputs must be
the VICAR files listed above (see Help <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visis2_level2.html#out">OUT</A>).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output file(s), a maximum of ten, either VICAR files generated from a
NIMS ISIS cube file or an ISIS cube file generated from VICAR files.  

If an ISIS cube file is used as input, the following outputs are generated:

	1) 2DHIST file,
	2) SPECPLOT files (0-6), 
	3) Merged mosaic cube file
	4) Geometry cube file
	5) Spectral Index Image cube file

Note that the user must specify the correct number of outputs corresponding
to the number of objects in the ISIS cube.  This can be determined either
by searching its PDS label, or by trial and error.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="histfile"><H3>HISTFILE</H3></A><pre>
This is the name of an ascii text file containing ISIS history labels.

In inverse mode, any ISIS history labels found in the input ISIS cube will 
be written to this file, if specified.  

In forward mode, if this parameter is specified, then the history labels
will be read in and stored in the output cube history, immediately preceding
the VISIS2 history of the job itself.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="requestr"><H3>REQUESTR</H3></A><pre>
STRING PARAMETER - Name of processing requestor.  Used only in the generation 
of the ISIS cube file.  Maximum of 25 characters.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="taskname"><H3>TASKNAME</H3></A><pre>
Name of the task containing the label items defining the cube attributes.
Normally the default (NIMSCMM2) will valid.  However, if the cube was
was extracted from an ISIS "Qube" using VISIS2 in inverse mode, then 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/dev/html/vichelp/visis2_level2.html#taskname">TASKNAME</A>=VISIS2 is required.  This keyword is used in forward mode only.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="specialp"><H3>SPECIALP</H3></A><pre>
This a flag to indicate that the program should write a "Special Processing" 
label item to the PDS label (forward mode only).

Currently there is only one Special Processing value:

SPECIAL_PROCESSING_TYPE = 1 means that the EDR used for the cube generation
was "garbled" and had to be corrected by hand in order to be made readable.
This correction procedure caused the resolution of some bands to be
compromised.

Other values for this parameter may be added in the future.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="to_ori"><H3>TO_ORI</H3></A><pre>
This allows the user to specify direction of the line/sample OFFSET label
items (inverse mode only).

Normally, this is controlled by the TO_ORIGIN label keyword, but cubes made
between 19 Oct. and 9 Dec. 1997 in Perspective projection are missing this
item.  For these (and possible other anomalies), the user should specify
this keyword when running VISIS2 in inverse mode.
