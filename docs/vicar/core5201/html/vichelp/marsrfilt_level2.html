<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt.html">MARSRFILT</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input files contain the XYZ coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing X, Y and Z values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (X,Y,Z) order.

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
The output of MARSRFILT is a single 3-band file of type REAL (float).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="navtable"><H3>NAVTABLE</H3></A><pre>
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#navtable">NAVTABLE</A> it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="origin"><H3>ORIGIN</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the 3D point to compute the range from.  By default it's set to
camera location as specified by C-point for CAHV-based instruments.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="corr"><H3>CORR</H3></A><pre>
Correlation accuracy, in pixels.  Generally this is quoted as 0.25, 0.33,
or 0.5 depending on who you ask.  The default for this program is 0.25,
which errs on the side of less filtering.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="baseline"><H3>BASELINE</H3></A><pre>
Override for the camera <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#baseline">baseline</A>, in meters.  The baseline is determined by
the STEREO_BASELINE label (as written by marsxyz).  If this label item is
not present, it must be specified via this parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="aspect_ratio"><H3>ASPECT_RATIO</H3></A><pre>
Allows the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> (and thus the Gaussian kernel) to be distorted <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#out">out</A> of
saure (round).  The default of 0.5 means the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> in the Y direction is half
of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> in the X direction.  This is appropriate for most normal in-situ
scenes, but in a case like the InSight workspace (arm camera looking more or
less straight down), a circular kernel (1.0) may be more appropriate.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="num_sigma"><H3>NUM_SIGMA</H3></A><pre>
Controls how many sigma are included in the actual <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A>.  The higher the
value, the steeper the Gaussian, meaning values near the center are weighted
more.  A value near 0 emulates a simple box filter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="wfactor"><H3>WFACTOR</H3></A><pre>
Controls the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> size.  A value greater than 1 makes the window bigger
than the nominal computed size.  See the main help text for the formula.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="window"><H3>WINDOW</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the size of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> used for the initial range smoothing
boxcar filter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ifov"><H3>IFOV</H3></A><pre>
Override for the instantaneous field of view (angular size of one pixel), in
radians.  The default is to determine this from the camera model.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="prox_min"><H3>PROX_MIN</H3></A><pre>
Defines the inner edge of the proximity filter (see main help).  This factor
is multiplied by the actual range error to get the edge of the filter in
meters.  Any pixels closer than this to the central range will not be
affected by the proximity filter.  Those between this and the maximum will
be scaled linearly.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="prox_max"><H3>PROX_MAX</H3></A><pre>
Defines the outer edge of the proximity filter (see main help).  This factor
is multiplied by the actual range error to get the edge of the filter in
meters.  Any pixels farther than this from the central range will be
excluded from the plane fit.  Those between this and the minimum will be
scaled linearly.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="cast"><H3>CAST</H3></A><pre>
Specifies how to reconstruct the XYZ point - casting either long the camera
model (-CMOD) or along the original vector (-RAY).  See the main help for
a more complete discussion.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="min_window"><H3>MIN_WINDOW</H3></A><pre>
Minimum <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">window</A> size for range filter.  This ensures a minimum level of
filtering even for very nearby data.  See the main text for full writeup.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="spike"><H3>SPIKE</H3></A><pre>
Turns on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#spike">spike</A> filter.  See the main text for a full writeup.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="spike_window"><H3>SPIKE_WINDOW</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#window">Window</A> size for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#spike">spike</A> filter.  See the main text for a full writeup.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="spike_rangesq"><H3>SPIKE_RANGESQ</H3></A><pre>
Threshold for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#spike">spike</A> filter.  See the main text for a full writeup.

The proper value of this depends on camera resolution.  The default of
.001 IS APPROXIMATELY CORRECT FOR THE MSL NAVCAMS.  THE MSL M34 (ML) VALUE
that works best appears to be about .00045, and for M100 (MR) the value
appears to be about .00015.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing using OMP, which uses multiple cores on
a single host machine.  The default is on.  The help for e.g. marsmap
describes some environment variables that can further control parallel
processing.  Note that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built
in to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP
documentation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for all input parameters and output values,
and the XYZ points themselves.  The interpretation of the values is dependent
on the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_name"><H3>DATA_SET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A> typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_id"><H3>DATA_SET_ID</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> is an abbreviation of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="release_id"><H3>RELEASE_ID</H3></A><pre>
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A> is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="product_id"><H3>PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_id"><H3>PRODUCER_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#producer_id">PRODUCER_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_inst"><H3>PRODUCER_INST</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.

asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="target_type"><H3>TARGET_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrfilt_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.
