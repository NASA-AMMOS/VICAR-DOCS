PURPOSE

    EDIBIS is an interactive screen editor for editing IBIS 
tabular or graphics files on a VT100 compatible terminal.  The command 
entry is similar to keypad <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> in the EDT editor. Support also
exists for performing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> in batch-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, without a terminal.
Note: If your terminal does not generate vt100 keypad codes, you can
use the batch-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> on the EDIBIS command-line instead.

   EDIBIS  IBIS.INT
This example shows how to edit an existing IBIS tabular file.

   EDIBIS  IBIS.GR   <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#gr1dim">GR1DIM</A>=3
This example shows how to edit an existing 3D IBIS graphics-1 file.

   EDIBIS  INPUT.INT OUTPUT.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#cols">COLS</A>=(1,3,4) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#lcol">LCOL</A>=200
This copies the desired columns in the input file to the output, increases
the output column length to 200, and edits the output.

EXECUTION

   EDIBIS  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#out">OUT</A>=NEWFILE.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#ncol">NCOL</A>=10 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#lcol">LCOL</A>=100
This creates a tabular file with 10 columns of 100 rows each.

   EDIBIS IBIS.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#scrnsize">SCRNSIZE</A>=132
To edit in 132 column <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> on the terminal, first put the terminal in
132 column <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> with a SET TERM/WIDTH=132, and then specify the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#scrnsize">SCRNSIZE</A>
parameter.

   EDIBIS IBIS.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">FORMAT</A>="(F10.4)"
This sets the initial <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> for all of the columns to F10.4 .
(This will only work for IBIS-1 files. IBIS-2 files are formatted).
<A NAME="examples">EXAMPLES</A>

   EDIBIS a b <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#cols">cols</A>=(1,2,4) command=("(1,3) search 4.567","delete",exit)
    top,paste,exit)

This puts EDIBIS into batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, first doing a search through
column 3 for 4.567, and deleting the found column.

   EDIBIS  old command=("(1,2) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> (a4)","search not",     cut,"(3,0) paste",exit)

This set of batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> first changes the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> of 
column 2 to "(A4)", and then searched for the string "not",
and if found, clears the cell and pastes the value into row 3.
OPERATION

Interactive <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">Mode</A>:

    The EDIBIS tabular file editor allows one to roam through <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#out">out</A> the
file looking at and changing any of the data values.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> for
each column may be specified so that real numbers, integers, and character
data may be displayed and entered.  The numeric keypad is used for the
command entry, which is patterned after the EDT keypad <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A>.
The screen serves as a window into the tabular file.  Eighteen rows
and as many columns as fit are displayed.  The current cell is
highlighted and header information is display at all times.  The header
information consists of the file name and size, the current row and column,
and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> of all of the columns being displayed.  Data and command 
information is entered at the lower left corner of the screen.
OPERATION

Batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">Mode</A>:

Batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">Mode</A> is invoked when the "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>" parameter is used.
In this case interactive <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is turned off and the file is manipulated
using the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> specified by the parameter. See the COMMANDS
parameter for more information. A description of each command is
given below.

The batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> may also be used interactively by placing the
command on the EDIBIS command-line, prefaced by a "/" character, e.g.

    ]  /(1,2) set 5.1


FAILURE <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> IN BATCH OPERATIONS

NOTE: In older versions no ABEND calls were made upon detecting errors
The basic assumption was that you were at an interactive terminal
and you could reenter bad <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A>. This created problems in Batch
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> in long scripts if a bad command was entered.

This particularly could be a problem  when _onfail was set to
STOP. The abend signal was never sent so the script continued. If
the proc continued for minutes to hours you may never notice that
the command had failed.

After 14-Aug-2011 this <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#version">version</A> will issue an abend for BATCH <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A>
operations, i.e., when <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>=("some command") parameter is provided.
 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

SETTING CELL VALUES:

Batch command: "(row,col) SET &ltvalue&gt", where the (row,col) is optional.

    The value of the current cell is changed by typing the desired new value
and pressing the Return key.  If the entered value is illegal then the
cell value will not be changed.  There are a few cases where this is
the *only* way to set a value. For example, if column 2 is ASCII, 
and you want to set the value of cell (1,2) to "quit", you can't just type
"quit", because that is the command to quit EDIBIS without saving the
file. So, to set the cell value, give the command:

    ] /(1,2) set quit

To set a string value containing spaces, put it in quotes "like this".
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

MOVING AROUND

Batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">Commands</A>: "TOP" "BOTTOM", "LEFT","RIGHT".

    The arrow keys move the current cell one place in the appropriate 
direction.  If the cell is at the edge of the screen, scrolling is performed.
As with the EDT editor there is a forward <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> and a backward mode which 
are selected by (keypad 4) and (keypad 5), respectively. Using the GOLD KEY
(PF1 key) with these keys advances the file to the bottom row or top row,
respectively.

    Page up and page down (keypad 8) and page left and page right (keypad 2)
move the screen one window size unless the edges of the file are encountered.
The direction forward/backward <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is determined by the previously mentioned
keypad <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A>.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

MOVING AROUND (cont'd)

Batch command: "Row N", "Column M" and/or "(N,M) JUMP"

    The current row may be set to a particular row by typing an integer and
touching the (keypad enter) key. The current column may be set by typing
an integer and using GOLD KEY and (kepad enter). 

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

DELETING/INSERTING ROWS:

 Batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">Commands</A>: "(row,col) DELETE N" 
             and "(row,col) INSERT N". The (row,col) is optional.

    Any number of rows may be deleted or inserted at the current position
by typing the number of rows and pressing (keypad PF4) or (keypad PF1,
keypad PF4) respectively.  If no number is specified then one row is 
deleted or inserted.  The inserted rows are inserted after the current 
line and are filled with zeros.

Warning: the whole file must be rewritten for these two <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A> so 
they can take a while, especially if the file is large.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

CUT/PASTING Values:

Batch <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">commands</A>: "(row,col) Cut" and "(row,col) PASTE".

    The (keypad -) key zeros (or blanks, if character <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A>) the current
cell.  The (keypad PF1, keypad -) combination changes the current cell by 
recalling the value of the last zeroed cell.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

COLUMN FORMATTING (IBIS-1 only)

Batch command: "(row,col) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">FORMAT</A> (formt)" where the (row,col) is optional.

    The display <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> of the current column is automatically determined
for IBIS-2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> files, and is set to floating point for IBIS-1 and
GRAPHICS-1 files. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> may be changed by typing the
new <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> and then typing ^F.  The format string must be a legal
Fortran <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> statement beginning and ending with parentheses.  If
blank spacing is specified (e.g. 2X) it must precede the data part or
it will be ignored.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> string itself must be less than or equal 
to 16 characters, and the length of the display it specifies must be less 
than or equal to 32 characters. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

SCREEN-REFRESH/HELP

    The screen can be refreshed (i.e. redisplayed) with the ^R key.

    The (keypad PF2) key will display a brief command summary.  Hit 
&ltreturn&gt for batch-command help, and any other key (e.g. spacebar) to
go back to editing.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

SEARCHING FOR VALUES

Batch Command: "(row,col) SEARCH &ltstring&gt", where (row,col) is optional.

   The PF1 PF3 combination will initialize the EDIBIS search <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A>.  It will
prompt you with:

	ENTER RANGE]

and will take the command string to be a range of values to search for
within the current column marked by the cursor.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>

SEARCHING (ctd')

Batch Command: "FWD" and "BACKWARD"

 The direction of the search is determined by the keypad FWD/BACK <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A>,
and valid syntax for search strings is as follows:

	ENTER RANGE] VALUE	Find first exact match to VALUE
	ENTER RANGE] MIN:MAX	Find first value not outside interval
	ENTER RANGE] MIN:	Find first value not smaller than MIN
	ENTER RANGE] :MAX	Find first value not larger than MAX

If the column is in CHARACTER <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A>, a string match is performed.
ENDING AN EDITING SESSION

Batch Command:  "EXIT" will save the file and quit.

In interactive <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#mode">mode</A> "EXIT" will save and quit, and "QUIT"
will exit without saving the file. If the file was opened
read-only no saving is done at all.

VMS SHORT-CUTS:

    The editing session is ended, the file saved, and the program ended
with the ^Z key.    Hitting ^C will abort and leave a temp file called 
'EDIBIS.TMP' -- the scroll will be disabled ,though.  The session may be
gracefully aborted with the ^D key or by typing "quit"; no changes or
temp files.

RESTRICTIONS

The maximum number of columns allowed for IBIS-1 tabular files
and GRAPHICS-1 files is 40, and for IBIS-2 files the limit is 1024.
There is no limit on the column length.
The each cell may occupy no more than 64 characters on the display.

REVISION HISTORY
            
1987-10-07 NDR - ADDED SEARCH AND QUIT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#commands">COMMANDS</A>
1991-02-04 NDR - FIXED BUG CAUSING LOCKOUT WHEN "NEXT SCRN"
                 KEYS HIT ON WYSE TERMINALS (FAILED IN INPUTKEY).
                 Ref:   FR #66574 by C. Avis
1994-11-17 NDR - Changed code to use direct IBIS2 routines
                 for forward compatibility. Converted all
                 FORTRAN I/O to C for portable coding.
                 Added scripting and command-line features.
                 and portable "curses" library windowing.
2011-08-14 RJB - Fixes for gcc 4.4.4 under Linux
                 In SUBROUTINE CONVERT_STRING_TO_COMMAND
                 had to add new call CALL FIND_ROWCOL
                 THISROW and THISCOL are found from list directed read
                 in gcc 4.4.4:
                 READ (CMDLINE(CMDPOS:),*,ERR=332) THISCOL i
                 does not detect properly the trailing ")" as a terminator
                 It gives an error, where the older compilers evidently 
                 recognized ")" as a proper terminator
2012-12-08 RJB - Fixes edibis_windows.c and dibis_terminal.c
                 For POSIX compliance with RedHat Linus 6.2 and 
                 MacOSX 10.7.4
2013-08-30 RJB - Changed a variable that failed in AFIDS
                 autotools make environment (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#version">VERSION</A> to VERS) 
2013-09-02 RJB - Changed mabend call to xvmessage + abend. Had
                 some kind of buffer overrun on output with mabend
2019-06-13 WLB - IDS-7924: Switched to constant string <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/edibis_level2.html#format">format</A> descriptor.
                 Added logging to test script.
