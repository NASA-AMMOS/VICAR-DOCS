Fcnpolar is a VICAR program that fits a function to a set of data points
obtained from a polarization test involving the program srchedge.  Fcnpolar
uses the subroutine metropolis to compute the parameters of the function and
it outputs the results to the screen.

EXECUTION

	fcnpolar filename

OPERATION

The form of the function is:

	VALUE = A + B * COS(ANGLE - THETA)**2

where A is the level,
      B is the scale factor, and
      THETA is an angle in degrees.

VALUE and ANGLE are obtained from the table of data points and the
parameters A, B, and THETA are calculated using metropolis.

Fcnpolar produces five fits.  Note that the answer= line in the output
lists A, B, and THETA in that order.  Values for sigma and error are also
displayed.

PRECISION
	Some variation in output will occur due to the use of subroutine
	metropolis, which uses random numbers.  See farenc.pdf and
	metropolis.pdf for details.
