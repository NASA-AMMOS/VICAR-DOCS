<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#inp">INP</A> is the dataset of tiepoints, in the format generated by PICREG.
It has 800 pixels per line (record), organized as 200 sets of new line,
new sample, old line, old sample. Following the last tiepoint is a set
of four zero values.

Output triangles dataset.  This dataset contains one line for each triangle, 
with 12 real values (samples, or columns) per line.  The 12 columns are:
    1.    New line location of uppermost vertex of triangle
    2.    New sample location of uppermost vertex of triangle
    3.    New line location of middle vertex of triangle
    4.    New sample location of middle vertex of triangle
    5.    New line location of lowermost vertex of triangle
    6.    New sample location of lowermost vertex of triangle
    7.    Coefficient C1
    8.    Coefficient C2
    9.    Coefficient C3
   10.    Coefficient C4
   11.    Coefficient C5
   12.    Coefficient C6

          where   OldLine = C1*NewLine + C2*NewSample + C3
                OldSample = C4*NewLine + C5*NewSample + C6

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#nlin">NLIN</A> is the number of lines in the input image to the geometric rectification 
program.  It does NOT refer to the size of either the input or output datasets 
of TRIGRID.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#nsin">NSIN</A> is the number of samples in the input image to the geometric rectification

TRIGRID encloses the input tiepoints with a border of synthetic tiepoints along
the borders of the input image.  To do this, it selects <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#toppts">TOPPTS</A> points,
equally spaced along the top (and bottom) of the input image.  The three
nearest real tiepoints are used to compute the corresponding new line and new
sample for each synthetic tiepoint.

TRIGRID encloses the input tiepoints with a border of synthetic tiepoints along
the borders of the input image.  To do this, it selects <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#sidepts">SIDEPTS</A> points,
equally spaced along the each side of the input image.  The three nearest
real tiepoints are then used to compute the corresponding new line and new
sample for each synthetic tiepoint.

If the input tiepoints are generated by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#envi">ENVI</A>, enter the tiepoint dataset name
here, rather than for the parameter <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/trigrid_level2.html#inp">INP</A>.
