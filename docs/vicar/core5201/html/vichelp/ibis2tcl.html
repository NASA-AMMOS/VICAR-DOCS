PURPOSE

     "IBIS2TCL" transfers particular values specified by row and
column from an IBIS interface file to TCL variables.   The values
may be transfered in double, real, integer, or character (string) format.
The number of columns and column length may also be transfered 
to TCL variables.  Whereas the IBIS-1 strings were four characters
long, IBIS-2 character strings are allowed to be up to eighty (80)
characters long.


EXECUTION

  ibis2tcl  FILE.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v1">V1</A>=LAT <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v2">V2</A>=LONG <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v3">V3</A>=LABEL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v4">V4</A>=COUNT    			<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A>=(1,1, 4,3, 2,2, 4,5)  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vartype">VARTYPE</A>=(0,0,2,1)

In this example, the input interface file is FILE.INT.  The real values at
(row 1 , col 1) and (row 4 , col 3) in the interface file are put into the
real TCL variables LAT and LONG, respectively.  The character data at (2,2)
is transfered to the LABEL string variable, and the integer format data
at (4,5) is transfered to the COUNT integer variable.
The TCL variable names are entered with the name parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v1">V1</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v2">V2</A>, ... , <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#v25">V25</A>.  
The variable names can also be entered positionally and real data types
assumed:

  ibis2tcl  FILE.INT  LAT LONG   <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A>=(5,6,2,1)


<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A> can be defaulted in which case the assumed locations start with the
first row and column and continue with all the elements in each row for as
many rows as required to get <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#varcnt">VARCNT</A> elements:

  ibis2tcl  FILE.INT  A B C D E F  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#varcnt">VARCNT</A>=6

The number of values put in TCL variables is equal to the number of locations
specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A> or is specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#varcnt">VARCNT</A> if IBISLOC is defaulted;
there should be enough variables listed to accommodate that many.  If the
locations are defaulted then <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#varcnt">VARCNT</A> must be specified.


The number of columns and/or the length of the columns in the interface
file can be transfered to TCL integer variables.  Values in the interface
file can be transfered as well.

  ibis2tcl FILE.INT  LABEL  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A>=(6,1) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vartype">VARTYPE</A>=2  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vncol">VNCOL</A>=NCOL  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vclen">VCLEN</A>=CLEN
  ibis2tcl FILE.INT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vclen">VCLEN</A>=CLEN




The following procedure is an example of its use:

PROCEDURE
  LOCAL LAT   TYPE=REAL
  LOCAL LONG  TYPE=REAL
  LOCAL LABEL TYPE=(STRING,4)  !4 for IBIS-1, up to 80 for IBIS-2
  LOCAL CLEN  TYPE=INTEGER
BODY
  ibis2tcl  FILE.INT  LAT LONG LABEL    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#ibisloc">IBISLOC</A>=(1,1,4,3,2,2)     					<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vartype">VARTYPE</A>=(0,0,2)  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vclen">VCLEN</A>=CLEN
  write "LAT = &LAT    LONG = &LONG "
  write "LABEL = &LABEL"
  write "COLUMN LENGTH = &CLEN"
END-PROC





RESTRICTIONS

The TCL variable types must match the type specified with the
    <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/ibis2tcl_level2.html#vartype">VARTYPE</A> parameter.
The TCL variables for the number of columns and the column length 
    must be of integer type.
The maximum number of TCL variables allowed per execution is 25.
The interface file cannot have more than 1,000,000 rows or 200 columns.
