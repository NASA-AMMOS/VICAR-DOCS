<pre>
      REPAIR identifies bad lines (lines that are inconsistent with the
surrounding lines) and replaces them by interpolation of the nearest good 
lines. If the locations of the bad lines or line segments are known, the user 
may list the offending lines and use the ALL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A> to repair just those lines.
If the locations of the bad lines are unknown, the program decides which lines
are bad by computing the interline correlation (and optionally the differences
in the means and the variances).
      REPAIR can now repair multichannel data in BSQ or BIL organizations. All
channels are tested in aggregate, and if the line is found to be bad, the line
is replaced in all channels. No specific channel repairs are presently 
implemented.
 OPERATION
      There are three modes of operation to REPAIR. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A> and MV modes 
differ only in the tests employed to determine bad lines, but the ALL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A> 
does no statistical testing, and is more closely related to the earlier VICAR 
program SAR. 
      In the ALL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, lines or regions are specified by the user via the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A>, and/or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> parameters. These regions are replaced by means
of a linear interpolation, using the lines immediately above and below the 
region. Interpolation is performed in the line direction only, and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">area</A> 
outside the specified regions is unchanged.
      In the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A> and MV modes, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#modulo">MODULO</A> 
parameters are used to identify regions to be examined for bad lines. If all 
three parameters are defaulted, the entire image is tested. Each line that is 
to be checked is tested by the following procedure:
      A. The line is compared to two reference lines: the last good line, and 
         the average of the next line and the last good line.
      B. If the correlation coefficients between the test line and both of the
         reference lines is less than the value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A>, then the line is 
         considered bad. There is one exception to this test. If the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#zok">ZOK</A> (Zero
         OK) keyword is in effect, lines that are all zeroes are passed as
         good. The correlation coefficient is undefined for lines of constant 
         value, requiring this special case. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 
         is assigned to all other cases involving lines of constant DN.
      C. If the MV (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">Mean</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">Variance</A>) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is in effect, then two additional 
         tests are employed. The test line is considered bad if its <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">mean</A> is 
         different than the means of the reference lines by more than the value 
         of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">MEAN</A>, or if its <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">variance</A> is different than both the reference line 
         variances by more than the value of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">VARIANCE</A>.
 If a line is found to be bad, the entire line is replaced by a linear
 interpolation of the last good line and the next good line. 
      This algorithm is fairly sensitive to the values of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">MEAN</A>, and
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">VARIANCE</A> parameters. It may be necessary to run this program more than once
 in order to find an appropriate set of values. In general, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#corr">CORR</A> and 
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">VARIANCE</A> values provide the best tests for random noise and hashed lines. The
 test of the means should only rarely be needed to reject a line.
      The coordinates used in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A> parameter (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#sl">SL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#ss">SS</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#nl">NL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#ns">NS</A>,...) refer to the
 input image, not the output image. This is important only if, in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#size">size</A>
 field, the starting line or starting sample is not one. 
      The user should also be aware that if two regions specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, 
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> contain the same line, the two regions will be combined 
 into one larger region that contains both original regions. This can cause
 problems, especially in the ALL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A>, where more pixels may be modified than
 were intended.
      This program will run on byte, halfword, fullword, or real data. Up to
 100 regions may by given by each of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#area">AREA</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#lineset">LINESET</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#badline">BADLINE</A> parameters.
 If either <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mean">MEAN</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#variance">VARIANCE</A> is not defaulted, the MV <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/repair_level2.html#mode">mode</A> is automatically
 used.
