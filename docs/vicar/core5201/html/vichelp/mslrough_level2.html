<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input files contain the XYZ coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing X, Y and Z values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (X,Y,Z) order.

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
Output file containing the roughness values.

The file will be in 2 or 3 band REAL (float) format.  See "OUTPUT FORMAT"
in the main help for the file format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uvw"><H3>UVW</H3></A><pre>
Input files contain the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing U, V and W values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (U,V,W) order.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> coordinates provided through the image files take precedence over the
single <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> vector provided through <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw_vector">UVW_VECTOR</A> parameter

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uvw_vector"><H3>UVW_VECTOR</H3></A><pre>
A single surface normal vector to be used at every XYZ point.  The image 
file(s) input through <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> parameter provide one UVW vector for each point of
the XYZ image file(s) input through <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#inp">INP</A> parameter.  However, the caller can
use <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw_vector">UVW_VECTOR</A> parameter to provide as input only one <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> parameter to be
used at every point in the entire XYZ image.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> parameter takes precedence
over <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw_vector">UVW_VECTOR</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="uvw_coord"><H3>UVW_COORD</H3></A><pre>
Coordinate system of the single <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw">UVW</A> vector provided through  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw_vector">UVW_VECTOR</A>
parameter.  This parameter is also ignored if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#uvw_vector">UVW_VECTOR</A> is ignore.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="inner_radius"><H3>INNER_RADIUS</H3></A><pre>
Inner radius (in XYZ space) of the ring, in meters.  Note that <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#inner_radius">INNER_RADIUS</A>
must be less than (or equal to) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#outer_radius">OUTER_RADIUS</A>.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#inner_radius">INNER_RADIUS</A> is not used
if -NO_RING is specified (internally, it is set equal to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#outer_radius">OUTER_RADIUS</A>).

Suggested value is 0.06 for MSL Drill, N/A for MSL DRT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="outer_radius"><H3>OUTER_RADIUS</H3></A><pre>
Outer radius (in XYZ space) of the ring, in meters.  Also the radius of
the overall roughness circle.

Suggested value is 0.075 for MSL Drill, 0.035 for MSL DRT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ring_outer_radius"><H3>RING_OUTER_RADIUS</H3></A><pre>
Outer radius (in XYZ space) of the ring, in meters.  Also the radius of
the overall roughness circle.

Suggested value is 0.075 for MSL Drill, 0.035 for MSL DRT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rough_ring"><H3>ROUGH_RING</H3></A><pre>
Upper limit on roughness values for the ring.  If a valid roughness exceeds
this value, it will change the flag in band 1 of the output.  Note that unlike
MARSROUGH, roughness values are not clipped; the ring roughness in band 3 (if
present) will show values greater than this threshold.

The parameter is ignored if -NO_RING is specified.

Suggested value is 0.015 for Drill, N/A for MSL DRT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rough_overall"><H3>ROUGH_OVERALL</H3></A><pre>
Upper limit on overall roughness values (across the entire <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#outer_radius">OUTER_RADIUS</A>
circle).  If a valid roughness exceeds this value, it will change the flag
in band 1 of the output.  Note that unlike MARSROUGH, roughness values are
not clipped; the overall roughness in band 2 will show values greater than
this threshold.

Suggested value is 0.04 for Drill, 0.005 for MSL DRT.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sphere_radius"><H3>SPHERE_RADIUS</H3></A><pre>
This setting is an optional test to rejects points that are nearby in pixels
but distant in meters (3D). The use case is to filter points that are within
the cylindrical projection but are in front or behind the point being tested
(happens often with near horizontal normals). This test is not ideal as it
will include points on the backsides of small peaks behind the point of 
interest and will ignore real hazards such as overhangs farther than the 
radius along the direction of the normal. A good setting might be a bit  
larger than the largest cylindrical radius provided (+ ~10% is what is 
used currently)

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bad_rough"><H3>BAD_ROUGH</H3></A><pre>
Value to use to indicate lack of roughness data.  Must be &gt= <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rough_ring">ROUGH_RING</A> and
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rough_overall">ROUGH_OVERALL</A>.  This value is reflected in the MISSING_CONSTANT label item.

Suggested value is 1.0.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter_scale"><H3>FILTER_SCALE</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is used to control the outlier filter.  Points with a roughness
larger than filter*sigma where sigma is the standard deviation of all points
within <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#outer_radius">outer_radius</A>, will be discarded.  This helps to eliminate spikes
and noise hits in the XYZ data.

Suggested value is 1.0.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_window"><H3>MAX_WINDOW</H3></A><pre>
Conservative guess at maximum window size (in line/sample space) in which
points falling into the radius will be found.  This is used to prevent
infinite loops, and a zero or negative value will cause a default of
MIN(num_rows, num_cols)/8 to be used (which should be acceptable given the
spatial resolution of the stereo data relative to the radius).

Suggested value is 150 pixels, which allows full coverage of the ring at
1mm/pixel close-in hazcam resolution.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="min_points"><H3>MIN_POINTS</H3></A><pre>
Minimum number of points in the region required to compute a roughness.
Should be greater than or equal to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#min_points">MIN_POINTS</A> used in the MARSUVW program.

Suggested value is 6 or higher.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="x_center"><H3>X_CENTER</H3></A><pre>
Center of bounding box (in XYZ space).  Points lying outside the box will not
have roughness computed for them.  This is used to limit computation to the
arm workspace.  The bounding box is measured in the coordinate system
specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> (usually ROVER).

Suggested value is 2.0 for MSL.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="box_radius"><H3>BOX_RADIUS</H3></A><pre>
Half-width of bounding box, in meters.  Points more than this distance away
from X/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#y_center">Y_CENTER</A> in either X or Y will not be computed (note, it is an axis-
aligned square box, not a circle).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_ring"><H3>DO_RING</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off ring computation.  The default is to do both overall and
ring roughness, which is appropriate for the MSL Drill.  Specifying -NO_RING
turns off the ring, leaving only overall roughness.  This changes the output
from 3 to 2 bands, limits the valid flag values in band 1, and may cause
mission-specific output label differences (for example, on MSL, -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#do_ring">DO_RING</A> is
assumed to be for the Drill, while -NO_RING is assumed to be for the DRT).

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#inner_radius">INNER_RADIUS</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rough_ring">ROUGH_RING</A> parameters are ignored if -NO_RING is set.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="data_set_name"><H3>DATA_SET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A> typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#data_set_id">DATA_SET_ID</A> is an abbreviation of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#data_set_name">DATA_SET_NAME</A>.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="release_id"><H3>RELEASE_ID</H3></A><pre>
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A> is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#release_id">RELEASE_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="product_id"><H3>PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_id"><H3>PRODUCER_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#producer_id">PRODUCER_ID</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="producer_inst"><H3>PRODUCER_INST</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="target_name"><H3>TARGET_NAME</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property

<A NAME="target_type"><H3>TARGET_TYPE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#target_name">TARGET_NAME</A>.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
The coordinate system to use for the output roughness (really just determines
the unit of measurement).  The interpretation of the values is dependent on
the mission.  Some representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame.  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> for rover missions).
Instrument - (default) The "natural" frame for the instrument 
    (of the first input image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> specifies which.VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#y_center">Y_CENTER</A>.VARI <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#do_curvature">DO_CURVATURE</A>
Specifies whether to
compute curvature not roughness.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bad_curve"><H3>BAD_CURVE</H3></A><pre>
Value that represents
missing or invalid
curvature.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="convex_high"><H3>CONVEX_HIGH</H3></A><pre>
Far threshold for allowed  
convex curvature 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="convex_low"><H3>CONVEX_LOW</H3></A><pre>
Closer threshold for allowed  
convex curvature 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="concave_low"><H3>CONCAVE_LOW</H3></A><pre>
Closer threshold for allowed  
concave curvature

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="concave_high"><H3>CONCAVE_HIGH</H3></A><pre>
Far threshold for allowed  
concave curvature
Center of bounding box (in XYZ space).  Points lying outside the box will not
have roughness computed for them.  This is used to limit computation to the
arm workspace.  The bounding box is measured in the coordinate system
specified by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord">COORD</A> (usually ROVER).

Suggested value is -0.4 for MSL.
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">coord_index</A> specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>.

Generally <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A> defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="solution_id"><H3>SOLUTION_ID</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/mslrough_level2.html#coord_index">COORD_INDEX</A>
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="omp_on"><H3>OMP_ON</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off parallel processing.  The default is on.  The main help
describes some environment variables that can further control parallel
processing.  Note that this program uses standard OpenMP (which is built in
to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further details can be found in the OpenMP
documentation.
