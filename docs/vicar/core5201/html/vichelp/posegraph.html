<pre>

The posegraph program performs pose graph optimization, which estimates the 
trajectory (collection of poses) from relative pose measurements. Input relative
poses are first computed given a list of images or an initial set of pointing parameters and saved in g2o <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">format</A>, then optimized, and finally the output 
corrected camera pointing is output as an XML file. The inputs and outputs are 
very similar to those of marsnav2 bundle adjustment. The goal of this is that 
the two programs can be used interchangeably for parameter optimization.

Typically, pairs of frames with very short baselines tend to have very
good feature tracking but the resulting XYZ points can have a large uncertainty.
Inaccurate XYZ points can drive bundle adjustment towards a local minimum, and 
fail in correctly optimizing the input camera pointings. On the other hand, very
large baselines tend to have poorer feature tracking due to perspective 
distortions and lighting changes, but tend to be better suited for triangulation
of XYZ points. Having an alternative to bundle adjustment for cases where it 
does not produce good results is important, since it optimizes parameters in a
fundamentally different way. 
 

PURPOSE:

The general idea of graph optimization is to express the pose estimation problem 
in structure-from-motion and SLAM in terms of a graph. Such a graph contains 
both nodes (vertices) and constraints (edges). In this case, a pose is denoted 
as a node, while observations between nodes, in this case relative orientation between cameras, are denoted as edges. The set of overlapping images are related 
to each other by tiepoints (input). 

The parameters and overall usage of POSEGRAPH is related to the MARSNAV2 and
also KEYFRAME_SELECTION programs, and is expected to used in conjunction with 
these. The overall goal of keyframe selection is to provide a set of frames 
to marsnav2 which provide better results than the original list. 

POSEGRAPH supports any mission, instrument, and camera model supported 
by the Planetary Image Geometry (PIG) software suite.


EXECUTION:

where ascii_listoffiles is a text file of image names and locations, one per 
line, containing the list of filenames to select keyframes from.

An input tiepoint list must be provided.

Note: there are two tiepoint file formats; "old" is the text-based list,
while "xml" is an XML-based <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">format</A>.  The format is auto-detected on read.
Over time "old" should be phased <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#out">out</A>. Output tiepoint file (see OUT_TPT)
is always in the new XML <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">format</A>. This can be converted back to the old 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">format</A> if necessary using marstie.

USAGE:
It is important that all images be connected to at least one other via 
tiepoints, and also strongly recommended that images be connected by 
"tracks". A track is an extension of a traditional tiepoint. A tiepoint is an association of 2 observations from 2 images, a track is an association of N observations from N images. A tiepoint is therefore a 2-elements track. 
All the observations of a given track "look" at the same ground location. 
A track is therefore associated to one XYZ ground coordinates. 

While posegraph does not currently deal with tracks directly, just tiepoints 
between pairwise images, conceptually having long tracks spanning multiple 
images manifests as a greater number of edges in the pose graph (more 
constraints). The greater the number of constraints, the more likely the 
optimization is to converge to an optimal solution, and not drift into local
minima, much like traditional bundle adjustment, and the effect of individual 
outliers is less likely to affect the outcome.  


METHOD:

Pose graph optimization problem is one example of a "simultaneous localization
and mapping" (SLAM) problem. 

Assume a rover has a state where a 3D vector represents the position and the orientation is represented as an Eigen quaternion, similarly to the pointings
available from telemetry readings. The measurement of the 
relative transform between the state at two timestamps is also assumed known or
can be estimated from the epipolar geometry (fundamental and essential matrices)
between pairs of views. Then, the residual implemented in the Ceres cost 
function computes the error between the measurement and the predicted 
measurement. Finally, the cost function needs to weight the residual by the uncertainty of the measurement. Hence, we pre-multiply the residual by the 
inverse square root of the covariance matrix for the measurement.

Eigen‘s geometry module is used with Ceres’ automatic differentiation 
functionality. To represent the orientation, Eigen‘s quaternion uses the 
Hamiltonian convention but has different element ordering as compared with 
Ceres’ rotation representation. Specifically they differ by whether the scalar component q_w is first or last; the element order for Ceres‘s quaternion is 
[q_w, q_x, q_y, q_z] where as Eigen’s quaternion is [q_x, q_y, q_z, q_w].
 
This is the general set of steps:
 
1) The tiepoint list is analyzed and a connectivity matrix is created such that
every (i, j) entry provides the number of tiepoints for that specific pair.

2) Given the above connectivity matrix and the tiepoints between frames,  fundamental matrices 'F' and essential matrices 'E' are computed between all available pairs if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#use_essential">USE_ESSENTIAL</A> is set; otherwise relative poses are computed directly between telemetry values for pairs of cameras and noise is added to 
avoid getting stuck in the current solution. 

The condition number of the data matrix for the fundamental matrix solve tends 
to be very high for short baselines, which is undesirable, so this is also taken into account.

Note that steps (3) and (4) below only apply if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#use_essential">USE_ESSENTIAL</A> is set.

3) In case of "good" fundamental matrices, the corresponding essential matrix is
computed from:

	E = K^T*F*K

where K is the 3x3 intrinsic parameter (calibration) matrix for the pinhole
camera model. The K matrix has the following form, where fx and fy are the focal
lenghts in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively, and similarly
for the principal point (px, py):

	K = [fx 0 px]
		[0 fy py]
		[0  0  1]

It must be noted that many of the images used within VICAR are acquired by 
fisheye lenses, where the mathematics for the fundamental matrix fall apart, as 
the standard epipolar geometry between pairs of views is defined for pinhole cameras. However, the approximation is for the most part correct if we focus on tiepoints obtained near the centers of the images. Therefore, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#edge_dist">EDGE_DIST</A> parameter is used to "crop <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#out">out</A>" tiepoints that lie near the edges of images, and 
the ones remaining are used in the computation of F and the epipolar geometry.   
 
4) The Essential matrix for each pair is decomposed into a relative orientation 
'R' and a relative translation 't' via its Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A
total of four valid answers are obtained, spanning R, -R, t, and -t. A 
"cheirality" test is performed to figure <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#out">out</A> which option yields XYZ points in 
front of the cameras. Once the correct (R, t) pair is obtained, the rotation R
is converted to a Hamiltonian quaternion 'q', with coordinates [x, y, z, w]. The
result is compared with the relative pose obtained from telemetry readings, and
if it has very large errors, it is not taken into account as an edge in the 
graph. 

5) The quaternion, translation, and information matrix per pair (more on this 
later) are placed on each line of the final g2o file. Pairwise relationships
make up the nodes of the pose graph, while the vertices are the absolute 
quaternion 'Q' and position 'p' of each camera, as determined from the pointing parameters. 

Note that both a "poses_original.txt" and "poses_optimized.g2o" file are saved 
in the current directory, as intermediate files, if the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#before_after">BEFORE_AFTER</A> flag is 
set.

6) Once the updated pointing is obtained, it is saved to an XML file, similarly 
to marsnav2.

NOTES:

Study the output log file, since it provides valuable information about
the process, such as tiepoints connectivity, pairwise keyframe scores, 
etc. 

Any tiepoints containing an image listed in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#ignore">IGNORE</A> list will be removed from consideration.  This allows you to concentrate on certain images without being influenced by others. IGNORE accepts ranges of images.

A note on the number of pointing parameters: posegraph EXPECTS seven pointing parameters, and won’t work if there is any other number since then a g2o file
cannot be created unless there is a relative quaternion and 3D position 
difference vector between two images. 

A note on computing the information matrix: this matrix must be provided per 
pairwise constraint, and is the inverse of the covariance matrix for the 
relative pose measurement. Since there is no straightforward way to compute said
covariance currently, this matrix is set to identity. 


PARALLEL EXECUTION

Part of this program has been parallelized using Open MP (OMP), which is built 
into the g++ compiler.

By default the number of threads used equals the number of cores on the machine
where the program is being run. Parallel processing can be disabled via the 
-OMP_OFF keyword.  The number of threads can be controlled by setting the 
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable before running the program.  There are 
numerous other OMP variables that can be set; see the OMP documentation.  
However, the number of threads is the only one that is likely to be useful in 
most cases.


TIEPOINT TYPES

Not all formats are supported in posegraph. Only the Traditional (0), 
fiducial (1), Z surface (8), Dynamic (9), and Miss (10) formats are currently 
supported. Other types may be added later on. 

IMPORTANT: Note that posegraph is only interested in the pixel 
association, i.e., left line/sample and right line/sample. It does not use 
other information (projected line/sample, z, for instance). In essence, 
all tiepoints are seen as traditional tiepoints by posegraph. Because 
of the nature of fundamental and homography matrix estimation, 
posegraph cannot (currently) use FIDUCIAL tiepoints, though it can read 
them in. The following specifies formats for each type of input tiepoint (xml).

G2O <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">FORMAT</A>

The g2o <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/posegraph_level2.html#format">format</A> is as follows:
VERTEX_SE3:QUAT i x y z q_x q_y q_z q_w 
EDGE_SE3:QUAT i j x y z q_x q_y q_z q_w info(x,y,z,phi_x,phi_y,phi_z)

where 'info' is the information matrix that represents the confidence in 
the measurement and it is the inverse of the covariance matrix. Hence, 
it is symmetric and positive semi-definite. We typically only store the 
upper-triangular block of the matrix in row-major order.
