<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
This is the image to be map projected. It is in the raw instrument space.
For example, this might be a Quickbird image. This should be in VICAR
format.

This image should contain metadata describing the initial RPC. For VICAR,
this is a GeoTIFF label with RPC.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ref_image"><H3>REF_IMAGE</H3></A><pre>
This is the reference image. This should be a map projected image, and 
contain metadata describing the map projection. For example, this might be
a CIB image. This provides ground truth.

This should be in VICAR format.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dem"><H3>DEM</H3></A><pre>
This is the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). This should be map projected
and contain metadata describing the map projection. 

This gives the height of the surface in meters relative to a reference
surface (usually Mean Sea Level WGS84).

This should be in VICAR format.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="landwater"><H3>LANDWATER</H3></A><pre>
This is the land/water mask. This should be map projected and contain
metadata describing the map projection.

This should be in VICAR format.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="maxdiff"><H3>MAXDIFF</H3></A><pre>
Maximum difference between initial warp of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/rpc_fit_level2.html#inp">INP</A> and REF_IMAGE, in meters.
This is used for determining the window size used in the initial iteration 
of the matching, so this should be an overestimate of the differences.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rpc_lnum_fit"><H3>RPC_LNUM_FIT</H3></A><pre>
This gives the parameters of the line numerator term of the RPC that we
will fit for. These should be numbers from 0 to 19. The default is to fit
for the constant term (term 0) and the height term (term 3).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rpc_snum_fit"><H3>RPC_SNUM_FIT</H3></A><pre>
This gives the parameters of the sample numerator term of the RPC that we
will fit for. These should be numbers from 0 to 19. The default is to fit
for the constant term (term 0) and the height term (term 3).
