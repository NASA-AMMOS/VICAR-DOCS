PURPOSE

     GTMOVE allows for the move or adjustment of a GeoTIFF map label
without moving the data in the image.  A possible use is to change
the scale of an image to attempt a PICMTCH3 correlation.  This allows
correlation to search for a fit in scale and rotation as well as 
translation.

A shift can also be specified.  It will be applied after the scale and
rotation.  If you want the shift to be applied before the scale and 
rototation, then do this shift by itself and then use a second call of
this routine with the scale and rotation (the operations are not
commutative).
	   
CALL
     gtmove input output scalefac rotation shift
  WHERE:
     input        is the input data set with a GeoTIFF label
     output       is the output data set with a "moved" GeoTIFF label
     scalefac     is a factor to change the scale (relative to the center)
     hskew        is a horizontal skew about the center
     rotation     is a rotation angle about the center
     shift        is a shift, appplied after the scale and rotation


  
OPERATION

Three points are generated for the input image.  Their mapping
is calculated by routine pixmap.  Mf2 is used to change the scale of
the three points and their rotation.  The resulting points are put
into gtgen to output the newly mapped image, maintaining the other
GeoTIFF parts of the label.

PERFORMANCE

About the speed of image copy.
