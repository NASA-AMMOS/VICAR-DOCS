PURPOSE
"lab2tcl" copies information from the system and history sections of a VICAR
label into user specified TCL variables.


EXECUTION

    procedure
    local lineInc real
    body
	lab2tcl  INP=file.img  V1=lineInc  KEYWORD=linc
    end-proc

In this example, "lab2tcl" searches for keyword "linc" in the HISTORY section
of image file "file.img"'s label (note that the program requires a variable
definition prior to use). If the keyword is found, its value is written into
the variable "lineInc"; if the keyword is not found, the message:
    Keyword LINC not found in label.
is displayed; the program will stop without searching for other specified
keywords. The label's value is returned as either an integer, a real, or a
string; label-add sets the value type, e.g.: 

	Integer		Real		String
	-------		----		------
	 787		787.		'787'
	 +3		+3e0		 '3'
	 -45		-45.78		'negative forty five.'

The variable whose name is given to the V1 parameter should be declared to be
of the same type as the expected value. 

Some of the label's information is stored in the SYSTEM section of the image
file. lab2tcl looks in the SYSTEM section if the 'SYSTEM switch is specified: 

    procedure
    local numlines integer
    body
	lab2tcl  INP=file.img  v1=numlines  KEYWORD=nl 'SYSTEM
    end-proc

In this example, "lab2tcl" searches for keyword "nl" in the SYSTEM section
of image file "file.img"'s label. "lab2tcl" will look in both sections of the
image file--in the order SYSTEM,HISTORY--if the 'ALL switch is specified:

    procedure
    local sampinc real
    body
	lab2tcl  INP=file.img  v1=sampinc  KEYWORD=sinc 'ALL
    end-proc

In this example, lab2tcl searches for keyword "sinc" in the SYSTEM section
first, then, if it wasn't found, in the HISTORY section. The "not found"
message will appear if the keyword is not found in the HISTORY section, either.

More than one keyword can be read at a time, setting a corresponding number
of variables (note that separate parameters are used for each of the variable
names; the parameters are numbered v1 to v20):

    procedure
    local numl integer
    local nums integer
    local fmt string
    local linc real
    local sinc real
    body
	lab2tcl  INP=file.img  v1=numl v2=nums v3=fmt v4=linc v5=sinc   	    KEYWORD=(nl,ns,format,linc,sinc)  'ALL
    end-proc

"lab2tcl" looks for each keyword individually, so that, in this example, it
will first look for keyword "nl" in SYSTEM then in HISTORY, then it will look
for "ns" in SYSTEM and HISTORY, and so on. The first missing keyword
terminates "lab2tcl" for all keyword retrieval.

If an empty string is specified for one of the keywords other than the first,
the corresponding variable will be assigned the value from the last retrieved 
variable:

    procedure
    local nl1 integer
    local nl2 integer
    local ns1 integer
    local ns2 integer
    body
	lab2tcl  INP=file.img  v1=nl1 v2=nl2 v3=ns1 v4=ns2   	    KEYWORD=(nl,"",ns,"") 'SYSTEM
    end-proc

In this example, variables nl1 and nl2 are assigned the value found for keyword
"nl", while ns1 and ns2 are assigned the value associated with "ns". Variable 
names cannot be omitted. The message:
    The first keyword in a KEYWORD list cannot be an empty string.
is displayed if an empty string is supplied for the first keyword; the program
will stop without searching for other specified keywords.


RESTRICTIONS
 1. A maximum of 20 variables can be returned at a time.
 2. The parameter KEYWORD must be explicitly mentioned, as in "KEYWORD=ns", 
    since each variable has its own parameter (V1,V2,V3,...,V20).
 3. Only the first value in a multivalued keyword is returned; this 
    restriction corresponds to label-add, which will only permit the
    first value to be written.
 4. If the keyword appears more than once in a section, the keyword 
    in the "current task" is used, where the "current task" is the
    last Task entry depicted in the label-list display.
 5. During a HISTORY search, "lab2tcl" looks at the current task for a
    keyword. If the keyword is not found, the program then scans
    backwards through the tasks starting with the second-to-last task.
    "lab2tcl" is limited to 100 tasks, however, including the current task.
