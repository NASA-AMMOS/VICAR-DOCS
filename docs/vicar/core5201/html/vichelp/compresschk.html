PURPOSE
     This routine will check two things
     1.  Is the user in the compressed environment (as of May 2008 there were
         two environments and two VICARS)
     2.  Is the file uncompressed (the label is checked)

     If both checks are positive, then the file is compressed.
	   
CALL
     compresschk INP
  WHERE:
     INP          is the image to be compressed
    
OPERATION

The file is compressed to a temporary filename.  The temporary file is then
diffed with the original to be sure that compression worked (as of 2008 the
programmers wanted extra assurance).  Then the original is deleted and the
compressed is moved (ush mv) to the original name.

PERFORMANCE

as fast as the compress copy program.
