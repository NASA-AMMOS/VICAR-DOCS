<H1>Help for KEYFRAME_SELECTION</H1>
<pre>

Keyframe_selection allows the user to obtain a list of keyframes from an initial
list of frames. The chosen keyframes should have good baselines for both feature tracking plus triangulation and pointing correction via bundle adjustment. The 
goal is to eliminate frames which can be problematic in the bundle adjustment
process. Typically, pairs of frames with very short baselines tend to have very
good feature tracking but the resulting XYZ points can have a large uncertainty.
Inaccurate XYZ points can drive bundle adjustment towards a local minimum, and 
fail in correctly optimizing the input camera pointings. On the other hand, very
large baselines tend to have poorer feature tracking due to perspective 
distortions and lighting changes, but tend to be better suited for triangulation
of XYZ points. There, we seek a "sweet spot" in the baseline of the input images
such that both feature tracking and the resulting bundle adjustment process can
be as accurate as possible. 

Keyframe selection is non-unique, meaning that different frames can be obtained
depending on run parameters and what the user desires. Currently, two modes are
supported: <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/keyframe_selection_level2.html#sequential">sequential</A> processing and global processing. Sequential processing 
is better suited for straight, linear motions such as those achieved by the 
Mars helicopter, where a given frame tends to share tiepoints only with other
frames in its temporal vicinity. Global processing is more general and includes
any type of motion, such that any frame can share tiepoints with any other. This
includes the movement of a robotic arm, a rover traversing terrain it had 
already visited, etc.
 

PURPOSE:
To perform a selection of keyframes from an original list of images. The set of 
overlapping images are related to each other by tiepoints (input). The keyframes
are recorded in a .txt file (output).

The parameters and overall usage of KEYFRAME_SELECTION is related to the 
MARSNAV2 program, and is expected to used in conjunction with MARSNAV2, which 
would receive keyframes as input. The overall goal of keyframe selection is to provide a set of frames to marsnav2 which provide better results than the 
original list. 

KEYFRAME_SELECTION supports any mission, instrument, and camera model supported 
by the Planetary Image Geometry (PIG) software suite.

where ascii_listoffiles is a text file of image names and locations, one per 
line, containing the list of filenames to select keyframes from.

An input tiepoint list must be provided.

Note: there are two tiepoint file formats; "old" is the text-based list,
while "xml" is an XML-based format.  The format is auto-detected on read.
Over time "old" should be phased <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/keyframe_selection_level2.html#out">out</A>. Output tiepoint file (see OUT_TPT)
is always in the new XML format. This can be converted back to the old 
format if necessary using marstie.

USAGE:
It is important that all images be connected to at least one other via 
tiepoints, and also strongly recommended that images be connected by 
"tracks". A track is an extension of a traditional tiepoint. A tiepoint is an association of 2 observations from 2 images, a track is an association of N observations from N images. A tiepoint is therefore a 2-elements track. 
All the observations of a given track "look" at the same ground location. 
A track is therefore associated to one XYZ ground coordinates. By 
construction, the maximum number of observations contained in a track is 
equal to the number of image in the project. It is also important to make 
sure that images or block of images are not disconnected from each other, 
otherwise a continuous set of keyframes will not be obtained. While keyframe
selection does not currently deal with tracks directly, just tiepoints between
pairwise images, the framework which deals with tiepoints and tracks is very 
similar. 


METHOD:

1) The tiepoint list is analyzed and a connectivity matrix is created such that
every (i, j) entry provides the number of tiepoints for that specific pair.

2) Given the above connectivity matrix and the tiepoints between frames,  homographies 'H' and fundamental matrices 'F' are computed between all available pairs. A homography can model the relationship between the left and right pixel values of a tiepoint very well for small baselines, but the error increases as
the baseline grows. The opposite happens for a fundamental matrix. The condition
number of the data matrix for the fundamental matrix solve tends to be very high
for short baselines, which is undesirable, so this is also taken into account.

3) A cost function is computed based on the parsimony between F and H for each 
pair, as well as a measure of the overlap between the images, as measured by the
ratio of the area occupied by matches versus the total image area, aR. The ratio
of condition numbers for F and H is also measure, aC. Parsimony is measured via 
the Geometric Robust Information Criterion (GRIC, Torr et al 1997). The cost 
function is the following:

	F = aC*aR*relGRIC(F,H)
	relGRIC(F,H) = GRIC(F)/GRIC(H)

This cost function is designed to increase in value when relGRIC(F, H) 
increases (meaning that F is a better fit than H for the given tiepoints), but 
at the same time be penalized for a bad condition number in solving for F 
relative to solving for H, which typically happens with very short baselines, 
and for relatively low aR values, which typically happen with large baselines.

4) The above cost function is computed across all available pairs and used to 
fill the keyframe scores matrix, whose dimension is NxN for N input frames.

5) Depending on the choice of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/keyframe_selection_level2.html#sequential">sequential</A> versus global processing, the keyframe
scores matrix is traversed via distinct algorithms, both of which result in a 
final list of frames which were chosen as keyframes. 


NOTES:

Study the output log file, since it provides valuable information about
the process, such as tiepoints connectivity, pairwise keyframe scores, 
etc. Overall, keyframe_selection was designed to be not just a program
to help automatically detect keyframes from a stream of images, but also
to be a diagnostic tool about the relationships between pairs of images.
For example, the resulting log file provides information about the 
condition numbers of the data matrices for homographies "H" and fundamental 
matrices "F", where for example a high condition number for the fundamental 
matrix typically occurs with very small baselines or pure rotations. On
the other hand, a relatively small number of matches between an image 
pair coupled with a very good estimation of "F" but poor for "H" typically
occurs when the baseline is too wide. Therefore, though a set of keyframes
is found automatically by this program, the output log file allows for
further analysis in manually adding or deleting more frames.

Finally, any tiepoints containing an image listed in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/keyframe_selection_level2.html#ignore">IGNORE</A> list will be 
removed from consideration.  This allows you to concentrate on certain images without being influenced by others. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/keyframe_selection_level2.html#ignore">IGNORE</A> accepts ranges of images.


PARALLEL EXECUTION

Part of this program has been parallelized using Open MP (OMP), which is built 
into the g++ compiler.

By default the number of threads used equals the number of cores on the machine
where the program is being run. Parallel processing can be disabled via the 
-OMP_OFF keyword.  The number of threads can be controlled by setting the 
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable before running the program.  There are 
numerous other OMP variables that can be set; see the OMP documentation.  
However, the number of threads is the only one that is likely to be useful in 
most cases.


TIEPOINT TYPES

Not all formats are supported in keyframe_selection. Only the Traditional (0), 
fiducial (1), Z surface (8), Dynamic (9), and Miss (10) formats are currently 
supported. Other types may be added later on. 

IMPORTANT: Note that keyframe_selection is only interested in the pixel 
association, i.e., left line/sample and right line/sample. It does not use 
other information (projected line/sample, z, for instance). In essence, 
all tiepoints are seen as traditional tiepoints by keyframe_selection. Because 
of the nature of fundamental and homography matrix estimation, 
keyframe_selection CANNOT (currently) use FIDUCIAL tiepoints, though it can read 
them in. The following specifies formats for each type of input tiepoint (xml).
