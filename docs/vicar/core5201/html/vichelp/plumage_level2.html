<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
Input files contain the labels from which the PLACES information is extracted.
Although the program is intended to work for EDR's, most RDR's have the proper
labels and could be used instead.

The input files can be listed on the command line, or in a list file, as with
the MARS mosaic programs.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
The output XML file, suitable for upload into PLACES.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="user"><H3>USER</H3></A><pre>
Override for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#user">user</A> name in the generated XML.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="method"><H3>METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Override the "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#method">method</A>" documentation string in the generated XML.  If
set to null (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#method">method</A>=--) then the method will be omitted.  Normally the
image's <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A> is appended to this string, unless -NO_PRODUCT_ID is
specified.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="institution"><H3>INSTITUTION</H3></A><pre>
Override the "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#institution">institution</A>" documentation string in the generated XML.  If
set to null (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#institution">institution</A>=--) then the institution will be omitted.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="product_id"><H3>PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Override for the product ID field.  The product ID is appended to the mission
string, unless -NO_PRODUCT_ID is specified, and is intended to provide
traceability to the source of the data.  This parameter should not normally
be used; the default is to extract <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A> from the label, which is more
appropriate.  Specifically, this parameter should not be used when multiple
files are being processed, because all files would then share the same
product ID.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_trace"><H3>DO_TRACE</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off the &lttrace&gt element.  This is a documentation-only element that
is ignored by PLACES.  It exists to help trace down where potentially bad
information in the XML file came from, for anomaly tracking.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_orig"><H3>DO_ORIG</H3></A><pre>
Turns on or off the &ltorigination&gt tag.  This contains metadata including
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#user">user</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#method">method</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#institution">institution</A>.  Because this metadata is currently associated
with the solution ID (always "telemetry" here), it really has no purpose.
If PLACES is changed to keep metadata with each solution, this can be
re-enabled.

The practical effect of this is that, if -NO_ORIG is in effect, the only
other parameters that matter are <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#inp">INP</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#out">OUT</A>, and MISSION.  Everything else
is ignored.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_product_id"><H3>DO_PRODUCT_ID</H3></A><pre>
Normally, the product ID (from the label, or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#product_id">PRODUCT_ID</A> override) is appended
to the "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#method">method</A>" string in the generated XML, in order to provide traceability
to the source of the data.  This keyword (via -NO_PRODUCT_ID) can be used to
disable this appending.  Note that the text of "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#method">method</A>" should be adjusted in
this case, since it is written assuming the product ID will follow.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_sites"><H3>DO_SITES</H3></A><pre>
Normally, SITE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM groups are examined, and unique sites are
output along with the normal rover frames.  Specifying -NO_SITE turns this
off, ignoring site coordinate systems.  Note that it is not an error for
the site group to be missing from the label.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_mechanisms"><H3>DO_MECHANISMS</H3></A><pre>
Normally, the joint angles in various articulation device labels are examined
and output along with the pose solutions.  This can be disabled via
-NO_MECHANISMS.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_observation"><H3>DO_OBSERVATION</H3></A><pre>
Normally, the exposure time and nstrument ID of images are written to an
&ltobservation&gt element.  This can be disabled via -NO_OBSERVATION.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="do_msl_init"><H3>DO_MSL_INIT</H3></A><pre>
If the -<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#do_msl_init">DO_MSL_INIT</A> flag is set, then the program will first look at the
INITIAL_STATE_PARMS group for the ROVER_MOTION_COUNTER and Rover position
and orientation.  If not found, it will revert to the standard labels.  This
allows PLUMAGE to find the "initial" state before visodom is run for those
kind of images.  The flag only applies to MSL images, but it is "safe"
for all MSL images.  It is ignored for other missions.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="min_sclk"><H3>MIN_SCLK</H3></A><pre>
If provided, specifies a minimum SCLK threshold.  Any images with a SCLK
below this value will be ignored.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="max_sclk"><H3>MAX_SCLK</H3></A><pre>
If provided, specifies a maximum SCLK threshold.  Any images with a SCLK
above this value will be ignored.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="add_site"><H3>ADD_SITE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/plumage_level2.html#add_site">ADD_SITE</A> parameter adds the given number to all Site indices.  The intent
is to be able to interact with the development PLACES server using "fresh"
Site territory (i.e. a range of sites not cluttered with previous data).
It should obviously never be used in operations.
