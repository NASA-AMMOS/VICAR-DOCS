PURPOSE

    clusan is a clustering algorithm that uses the simulated annealing
optimization technique to find the best cluster partition.  The input is
multidimensional data in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format.  The data are grouped into clusters 
which have the minimum scaled variance.  This clustering algorithm is
designed for finding the best cluster partition of a small number of
multidimensional data points; the maximum is 50000 points.


EXECUTION EXAMPLES

clusan DATA.<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>  (DATA.SDS,DATA.CLS)  MSS=6 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A>=(2,3,5,6) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A>=(6,4)            <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#incr">INCR</A>=10 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>=(100,100,500,500) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A>=10.

The input data are in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format; i.e. the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> are appended together
in the sample direction using the program <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>.  The pixels can be in any
format since they are converted to real in the program.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> parameter 
specifies how many <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> are in the input file.  

The first output file is a statistics dataset (like those produced by 
USTATS, etc)  which contains the number of data points, the mean vector, 
and the covariance matrix for each cluster.  This file can be used by
programs CLUSTEST and DENDSTAT.

The second output file contains the input data for those <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> that were 
used in the clustering and another band which gives the cluster number 
that the pixel was assigned to.  This file is in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format and has the 
same pixel format as the input file.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A> parameter specifies which bands in the input file will be
used for the clustering.  This allows the user to try clustering various
combinations of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> without having to make up a new input dataset each
time.  There must be at least two, but no more than twelve <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A>.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A> parameter guides the algorithm in choosing the number of 
clusters (see theory of operation).  The first number is the desired number
of clusters and the second number is about how many clusters the algorithm
can stray from the desired number.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#incr">INCR</A> (or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#linc">LINC</A>/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#sinc">SINC</A>) parameter is used to cut down on the number of
points to be used (since the maximum number is 50000).  This is also the
purpose of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> parameter.  

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> parameter sets a minimum value for valid pixels (objects).
Note that in the cluster dataset output all pixels on a line that lie
below <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> are moved to the end of the line and assigned the value 0.


clusan DATA.CLS  (DATA2.SDS,DATA2.CLS)  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>=5 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A>=(1,2,3,4) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A>=(8,2)  			'<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A>  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ncycle">NCYCLE</A>=25 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#niter">NITER</A>=100 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#temp">TEMP</A>=0.5

This example which uses the remaining parameters shows how to <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">restart</A> a 
clustering run.  To <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">restart</A> the run, the RESTART keyword is specified
and the second output file from the previous run is used for the input
file.  Note that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> in the new input file are in different positions
than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> in the old input file, and that the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#incr">INCR</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> parameters
need not be respecified, as the file has been compressed accordingly.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> is now 5, as the input contains only the 4 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> that were processed
in the first run, plus an additional pseudo-band containing cluster numbers.

The last three parameters will not usually have to be specified, but allow
some control over the optimization algorithm (see theory of operation).
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ncycle">NCYCLE</A> parameter is the maximum number of temperature cycles the 
algorithm will perform.  If it is large then the algorithm will lower the
temperature very slowly, but if it is too small the system will be
quenched and will not be at a true minimum energy configuration.
The algorithm will stop before doing <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ncycle">NCYCLE</A> temperature cycles if
the system is in a stable state (i.e. the energy is no longer decreasing).

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#niter">NITER</A> parameter specifies how many iterations are to be done for
each cooling cycle.  The default is to do 4 times the number of data points,
so that on average each point will be considered about four times per
cycle.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#temp">TEMP</A> parameter gives the initial temperature to start the system
off with.  The initial temperature should be of the order of unity.
A higher starting temperature will make the system behave more randomly
at first.

THEORY OF OPERATION

    Clustering is the technique of grouping data points (or objects) into a
number of groups based on similarities in the objects' measured attributes.
While for a small number of attributes (one or two variables) graphing the
data points can be used to easily find the clusters, as the number of attri-
butes becomes larger visual methods become impossible.  Many computer
algorithms exist which cluster data points in any number of dimensions.
One approach to the problem of clustering is that of optimization.  An 
objective function which measures the degree of clusterness is maximized over
all possible partitions of the data points into clusters.  Of course, a wide
range of such functions could be imagined.  There are also a wide variety of
optimization methods available to maximize or minimize functions.  Most such
methods are inappropriate because of the nature of clustering.  Clustering
involves discrete movements of objects between clusters, so that derivatives
are not a particularly useful concept.  Also there are many local minima
for optimization algorithms to get caught in.  One new algorithm which over-
comes these difficulties is called simulated annealing.
    Simulated annealing is analogous to the cooling and crystalization process
of a crystalline solid.  The objective function to be minimized is called the
energy of the system.  An object is randomly moved from one cluster to another
in analogy with the random motions of the atoms in a crystal.  If the energy
is thus decreased the change is accepted.  If the energy is increased the
change is still accepted with a probability depending on the Boltzmann factor:
exp(-deltaE/<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#temp">Temp</A>).  Thus increases in the energy comparable to the temperature
still have a good chance of being accepted while large increases in the energy
have very little chance of being accepted.  This allows the algorithm to
rattled its way <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#out">out</A> of local minima.  The temperature is at first set high so
that a lot of random motion occurs.  It is then gradually lowered until the
system freezes.  How exactly the temperature is lowered is called the
annealing schedule.  There are many possibilities for the annealing schedule,
but the one used in this implementation is that of Newton's law of cooling,
i.e. the temperature decreases exponentially:
  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#temp">Temp</A> = InitialTemp * exp(-const*Time) .

    The objective function in this program is the normalized average of the
cluster variances.  The variances in each attribute dimension are scaled by
the total variance of all of the data points in that dimension.  Thus the
results are independent of all scalings and translations of the attributes.
The variances of the clusters are averaged by weighting by the number of
points in each cluster.  Finally the average of the variances is scaled by
the number of attributes and scaled according to the number of clusters, so
that the energy function is invariant and can be compared between configura-
tions with different number of clusters.  The energy should always be of
order one.  The energy function treats all of the attributes the same and will
tend to make hyperspherical clusters even if the clusters should be long and
stringy.

    The algorithm also uses the simulated annealing technique to find the
number of clusters.  Every once in a while, it will try lumping two clusters
together or splitting one cluster up into two and will do the same Boltzmann
calculation to determine whether to accept the change.  The algorithm can be
guided to give about a certain number of clusters with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A> parameter.
The first value gives the number of clusters desired and the second value gives
a rough number of how many in either direction is acceptable.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A>=(6,2) 
means "I want 6 clusters give or take about 2".  This feature is implemented
by adding a parabolic term to the energy function, i.e. a term whose value
goes as the square of the difference between the actual number of clusters and
the desired number.



OPERATION STRATEGY

    The program starts <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#out">out</A> by randomly selecting the specified number of 
objects and setting all of the objects to the closest cluster.  Run the 
program a few times on the same data to see if same minimum energy is 
reached.  If you want the program to decide entirely by itself the best 
number of clusters, make <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A>(2) have some large value.  If the program 
has trouble converging to the same result it probably means that the data 
is not particularly clustered.  Generally the program quickly and reliably 
converges in cases where the data has well defined groupings.


PRECISION:   5-Sept-94
  1.	This portable version uses double precision,which provides a 
	capability to adjust the sensitivity to changes in the "ENERGY"
	For portablity testing, this version ignores delta "ENERGY" 
	changes less than .0000005.

  2.	CLUSTEST has always used double precision. The CLUSAN output 
 	statistical files which are used by CLUSTEST are single precision
 	(REAL*4).  The stated precision (from the VAX FORTRAN manuals) for
 	REAL*4 is "approximately 2**23, that is, typically seven decimal
 	digits".  In order to eliminate test differences (VAX vs. UNIX)
 	caused by reading the single precision values into double precision
 	variables, it is necessary to truncate the input values to six
 	decimal digits.  The truncation is currently being implemented by
 	the "ported' version of CLUSTEST.

  3.	The changes made for porting cause CLUSAN and CLUSTEST to perform
 	differently than the original baseline versions.  The main difference
 	appears to be the result of specifying default values for TEMP0 and
 	NCYCLES.  Not specifing default values for these parameters produce
 	inconsistent results between the different platforms.  For comparison
 	testing purposes, the original program was modified to use the same 
 	random number generator with the same seed value as the new ported 
 	versions.  However, even with these changes the original program does
 	not produce exactly the same results when run mutliple times.
