     Surveyor is an interactive, pull down menu based
program used to create terrain fly by animations. As 
input it takes two registered images (an image of the 
region from the top and an elevation image). The user 
then creates a flight path around the data interactively. 
Once the path is defined Surveyor can create the frames 
for the animation which can then be put on video tape, 
film etc. Surveyor is run outside of VICAR on Sun 
computers.

     Make sure SURVHOME/bin/sun4 is in your path before
running Surveyor. By doing a 'select d' the SURVHOME
environment variable will be automatically defined.

     To run Surveyor do the following at the command prompt:
&gt survd
&gt surveyor
     This will run Surveyor. If for some reason you exit from
Surveyor abnormally, make sure you kill the survd process.

     To find the process id of the survd process do:
&gt ps -auxww | grep survd

     And you will get something like:

&gt YourUserName  747  0.0  0.3 2272  152 ?  I    11:37   0:00 survd

     Then use the kill command to kill the stray survd process:

&gt kill -9 747

     For more information please consult the user guide.
Your system administrator should have a copy.
