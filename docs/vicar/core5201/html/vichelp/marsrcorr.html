PURPOSE:
Marsrcorr, which stands for Mars Regularized Correlation, is an image matching
program that computes regularized disparity maps. Traditionaly, image matching 
programs such as marscor3 and marsecorr, compute the disparity for each pixel
independently of the disparity found for neighbooring pixels. That is, no 
constraints are used between the disparity found at one pixel and the disparity
found at the pixel next to it. The merit of such approach is to have independant
measurements between pixels without any "effect" from the neighbors measurements.
(note that the measurements are not stictly independant because of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">template</A>
size, but we're referring here to the influence of the disparity found at one
pixel to the disparity found at the next pixel). The drawback of the approach 
however is the complete permeability to noise and outliers. Matching measurement
noise and outliers are ubiquitous to any matching algorithms; the wrong 
disparity will get the best matching score and will be selected as the winner.
Two neighbooring pixels could have a difference in measurements that do not make
sense and nothing will prevent that to happen. This leaves noise and outliers in
the disparity maps. The regularized approach on the other hand enforces a 
minimum of coherence in disparity found between neighbooring pixels. 
Essentially, a regularized approach is still looking for the best matching score
(as the standard approach does), but is willing to select not the best matching
score (but still a good one) if the relative disparity coherence between 
neighbooring pixels is improved. "Coherence" here is the assumption that from 
one pixel to the next, the change in disparity should be smooth, which is a 
translation of the assumption that the ground surface should be continuous and 
change smoothly - at the scale of the pixel. Note that occlusion causes sharp 
discontinuities in the ground surface, which invalidates the surface smoothness,
but this situation is also accounted for in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> scheme.
How much "coherence" to enforce does not have unfortunately a magic number and
is essentially a "knob" to adjust based on the scene and image noise. Too much
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> and the process will "erase" topographic surface, not enough 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> and noise/outliers will be left in the disparity map.

There are roughly 2 approaches for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>. Global method and Semi-Global
methods (SGM). The Global approach regularizes the disparity map based on the 
minimization of a cost that is accounting at once for all the pixel of the 
image. The resource needed (hardware and time) is usually prohibitively high. 
The second approach lessen the requirement on the resources by not accounting 
for all the pixels at once, but only accounting for a subset of them. Instead of
doing a full 2-dimensional minimization, SGM does a series of 1-dimensional 
minimization. There's a vast swath of litterature on various implementations of
the SGM, with various ways to define the smoothness criteria. See Hirschmuller, 
2008, "Stereo processing by semiglobal matching and mutual information" for SGM 
landmark paper. In 2005, an improved SGM algorithm was introduced, MGM (More
Global Matching) which reduces some of the typical SGM artefact (light striking
artefact in the disparity maps, along the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A>) without 
significant processing time penalty. See Facciolo, 2015, "MGM: A Significantly
More Global Matching for Stereovision". Both methods are available in this
program.





EXECUTION:
Here are some expected calls:

First, if the user has not a good idea on how to adjust the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>
parameters, the program should be run first with all the needed parameters and
-AUTOCORR to get an estimate of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameter

The simplest call (disparity with pixel accuracy, no <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A>):

marsrcorr <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=\(leftImage, rightImage\) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A>=disparity.img -AUTOCORR

This will print <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A> the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameters to use (for the given 
images, and default <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#template">template</A> size, matching algorithm, and disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> 
approach), but will not compute the disparity maps proper. The process needs to
be launched again with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameters:

marsrcorr <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=\(leftImage, rightImage\) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A>=disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#reg_params">REG_PARAMS</A>=\(...\)


Some prior information on the disparity map can be supplied to the program to
reduce the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space. For instance a global offset between the two images
or a disparity map at a lower resolution:

marsrcorr <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=\(leftImage, rightImage\) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A>=disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#reg_params">REG_PARAMS</A>=\(...\)
          <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#in_disp">IN_DISP</A>=priorMap.VIC


<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">Subpixel</A> matching precision is controlable via a parameter (SUBPIXEL):

marsrcorr <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#inp">inp</A>=\(leftImage, rightImage\) <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A>=disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#reg_params">REG_PARAMS</A>=\(...\)
          SUBPIX=4




PROCESSING:
The goal is to get, for each pixel of the left image, the corresponding pixel
in the right image.

At a high level, this is a 2-steps process:
- Compute the matching score volume: Run the matching algorithm as it would be
done with standard matching programs, except that instead of storing only the 
best matching score within the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space for a given pixel, store all the 
scores. This, depending on the image size and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space, can grow quite 
large (a pyramidal approach is available to limit the memory footprint needed)
- Apply <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> to the score volume to find the scores winners (based on 
SGM cost function to minimize). From the location of the score winners in the 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> area, derive the disparity maps.

Note that, currently, marsrcorr is expecting and looking for local 2D 
translations only. That is, the input images should be relatively close to what
is called a stereo-pair: roughly same resolution, baseline about perpendicular 
to viewing angle. It does not support the wider range of possibilities that
marsecorr support for instance.


DISPARITY <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">SEARCH</A> APPROACH:
To compute the disparity file, independently of any <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A>, there could
be different approaches. The standard approach is to do a 2D <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> around an
apriori initial location. Marsecorr program on the other hand runs a plane sweep
appoach (which require camera models), which essentially look for a matching 
pixel not around a 2D patch, but along the epipolar line. Although it is our 
hope to eventually implement a regularized plane sweep approach, as of now, the 
standard approach is implemented. The type of disparity <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> to use is 
controlled with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#disp_search">DISP_SEARCH</A>. By default, it is assumed that the Left and Right 
image are coregistered, that is, for any pixel in the Left image, the apriori 
location in the Right image is at the same (x,y). This could be modified using 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#in_disp">IN_DISP</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#affine_param">AFFINE_PARAM</A> which allows to supply different apriori location.
 
IMAGE MATCHING ALGORITHM:
The core of the matching step is an image to image comparison. There are two
algorithms available at the moment. The Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) and
the Zero-mean Sum of Square Difference (ZSSD). The algoritm of choice can be 
selected with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#match_img">MATCH_IMG</A>. The NCC is insensitive to affine constrast change 
whereas the ZSSD is insensitive to additional constract change only. ZSSD is 
therefore applicable in less scenarii than the NCC but is less computing
intensive. Nevertheless it is recommended to use the NCC as it is overall more
robust.

<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">REGULARIZATION</A>:
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> is the motivation for marsrcorr. It is formulated as finding
the disparity map that minimizes a cost E defined as:

E = sum(Cp(Dp)) + sum(V(Dp,Dq))
with Cp(Dp): matching score of pixel p at disparity Dp (note that matching score
is reversed: smaller is better). 
V(Dp, Dq): penalty change in disparity between pixel p and pixel q

V follows this rule:
V(d, d') = 0   if d=d'
V(d, d') = P1  if |d-d'| = 1
V(d, d') = P2  if |d-d'| &gt 1
Which means that there is no penalty for pixel that have the same disparity, a 
small penalty (P1) for small jump (1 pixel) in disparity, and a larger penalty
(P2) for disparity larger than that.

The energy is computed recursively along 1D <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> (usually along the 4 or 8
cardinal <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A>) that runs from one edge to the image to the opposite edge.

For instance, assume a NxN image pair matching with a 3x3 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space (9 search 
locations), and consider the SGM process when it is running along the line 
direction. We start at a given pixel on the left edge of the image (samp=0, 
line=y), and will end on the right side of the image (samp=N, line=y).
Along that direction a cost will be computed for each pixel and at each <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> 
position. It's a recursive cost that is computed as follow:
At a given pixel position (samp=x, line=y) and at <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> location (d), we will 
compute a list of "overall" costs with all the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> locations of the previous
pixel (samp=x-1, line=y). These overall costs L(x,d) are:
L(x,d) = C(x,d) + L(x-1,d') + V(d,d')  with d' = {d1, d2, ..., d9}
with L(x,d) the "overall" cost, C(x,d) the matching score a pixel (x,y), <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> 
position (d), L(x-1,d') the "overall" cost at the previous pixel, at <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> 
position d', and V(d,d') the penalty for jumping from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> location d to d'.
that is:
L(x,d) = C(x,d) + L(x-1, d1) + V(d,d1)  
L(x,d) = C(x,d) + L(x-1, d2) + V(d,d2)  
...
L(x,d) = C(x,d) + L(x-1, d9) + V(d,d9)  
and we select the smallest L(x,d) of all, which will be the overall cost for 
pixel (samp=x, line=Y) at disparity (d). 
That process is done for each pixel of the line, for all the lines (starting on
the left side of the image, up to the right side).

That process is done for all the 4 or 8 cardinal <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A> (user select):
along the line, going left to right      |
along the line, going right to left      |  4 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A>
along the sample, going top to bottom    |
along the sample, going bottom to top    |
along the diagonal, going topLeft to bottomRight   |
along the diagonal, going bottomRight to topLeft   |  4 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#directions">directions</A>
along the diagonal, going topRight to bottomLeft   |
along the diagonal, going bottomLeft to topRight   |

All the 4 (or 8) "overall" scores maps are then summed up, and for each pixel,
the disparity location with the overall best score win.



<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">REGULARIZATION</A> PARAMETERS:
The intensity of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> to apply is quite subjective. There's no
hard and fast rule, but more a continuum of increasing smoothness for which the
user must decide what is a good tradeoff between acceptable noise and too
smooth. These are essentially "knobs" to adjust.

The parameters depends on the type of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> applied. For now, only
one type of minimization function is available (see above), that is, a penalty
V is applied depending on the jump from <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> location from one pixel to the
next:
V(d, d') = 0   if d=d'
V(d, d') = P1  if |d-d'| = 1
V(d, d') = P2  if |d-d'| &gt 1

There are therefore 2 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#regularization">regularization</A> parameters to define (P1, P2). They are not
intuitively defined as they depends on the matching score. 
In the "penalized" score:
C(p) + V(d,d')
V needs to be sized properly against C, so it has some effect, but not too
much. C(p) depends on the images themselves (mainly texture, noise, and 
disparity) and image matching technique (NCC, ZDSSD) which renders the 
definition of P1/P2 situation dependent.
To facilitate the definition, marsrcorr provides estimates of P1/P2 (
-<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">AUTOCORRELATION</A>), by computing the autocorrelation of one image (the left in 
practice). The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> is the correlation of the image with a shifted 
version of itself. The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> is computed for a 1-pixel shift and a 
2-pixel shift, and are estimates for P1 and P2, respectively.

Note that if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> precision is required, 2 sets of P1 and P2 are needed. One
for pixel-wise matching, and one for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> matching. Remember that marsrcorr
do <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> matching in 2 steps: first pixel-wise <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A>, then subpixel search.
The matching score varies significantly between pixel-wise <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A>, which requires separate penalty coefficients. The estimates of the 2 
sets are also provided by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#autocorrelation">autocorrelation</A> process.


<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> PRECISION:
By default, the image matching is done at the integer pixel level. No <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A>
precision. This can be modified using the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> parameter. If used, the 
process operates in 2-steps: First a pixel-wise disparity map is computed, then
a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> between [-1,1] pixel is done, centered on the pixel-wise 
best location found and with a shift increment based on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">SUBPIXEL</A> value.
This is done in two steps to limit the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space at any moment given the
likely possibility of running <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#out">out</A> of memory. For example, a process running a 
full resolution M20 ncam pair (5120x3840) with a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#search">search</A> space of 3 pixels on 
each side and a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> resolution of 0.2 pixel would require 70GB (!!!) of
memory to store the matching score volume.
If a pyramidal approach is used, the matches are done with a pixel-wise
precision for all the pyramidal level. Once done, an extra match step is done 
with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsrcorr_level2.html#subpixel">subpixel</A> precision.
