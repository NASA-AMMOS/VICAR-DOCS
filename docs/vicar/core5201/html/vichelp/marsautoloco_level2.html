<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
File name of the orthomosaic to register to the base map. By default, the 
program will retrieve the orthomosaic scale, sample/line offset, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A>, if a
SURFACE_PROJECTION_PARMS property is in the label. If they are not there, then
the user will need to supply them through parameters (ORTHO_*).
However, even if the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> is in the label and is retrieved from there by the 
program, the user must still enter them. A check on <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> correspondence is done
and a warning is displayed if they differ. The reason for forcing the user to 
supply the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> although they can be read from the label is that at the time of 
the program writting is wasn't clear how to manage <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> gotten from PLACES and 
the one in the labels. This behavior might change eventually.


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="basemap"><H3>BASEMAP</H3></A><pre>
File name of the base map to register the orthomosaic (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#inp">INP</A>) onto. It is assumed
that the image label contains a IMAGE_MAP_PROJECTION property, with at minimum
the line/sample_projection_offset, map_scale, and line/sample_first_pixel 
information. Otherwise, the user will have to supply them through parameters
(MAP_*).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="dem"><H3>DEM</H3></A><pre>
File name of the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#dem">DEM</A> to use. The DEM is not used for the registration process. 
It is used at the end, once the ortho mosaic image map coordinates has been 
corrected, to extract the elevation of the map origin. This elevation is 
supplied in the output file.
Same constraints as the base map regarding labels.

<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ortho_northing"><H3>ORTHO_NORTHING</H3></A><pre>
This is a mandatory parameter. It is the Northing map coordinate of the 
orthomosaic. The coordinate is in the same map projection system as the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#basemap">basemap</A>.
It is a mandatory parameter as there is no other way to "connect" the base map
map projection (usually some equirectangular projection with clat=0, clong=0) to
the local map projection of the orthomosaic.

<hr>
<A NAME="search_range"><H3>SEARCH_RANGE</H3></A><pre>
Search range in (base map) pixel to look for the best coregistration between the
orthomosaic and the base map. The starting point is based on (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#ortho_northing">ORTHO_NORTHING</A>,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#ortho_easting">ORTHO_EASTING</A>) and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#search_range">SEARCH_RANGE</A> specifies the length of the exploration in each 
direction (up, down, left, right).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="weight"><H3>WEIGHT</H3></A><pre>
If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#weight">WEIGHT</A> is on, then the correlation is weigted. At each location of the search
space, the entire orthomosaic is correlated at once with the base map. In a non-
weighted correlation all the pixel have the same <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#weight">weight</A> in the correlation score.
However, if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#weight">WEIGHT</A> is ON, then each pixel has a different weigth in the 
correlation. Their <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#weight">weight</A> is inversely proportional to the distance between the
pixels and the pixel at which the map coordinates of the orthomosaic is 
attached. The "special pixel" (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#ortho_s_offset">ORTHO_S_OFFSET</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#ortho_l_offset">ORTHO_L_OFFSET</A>) usually 
corresponds to the location of the rover. The closer the pixels are to the 
rover, the more <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#weight">weight</A> they have in the correlation.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="corr_score"><H3>CORR_SCORE</H3></A><pre>
Output variable that will contain the correlation score. It can be retrieved
using the v2param function.
If correlation score is equal to 0, that means that the maximum correlation was
found on the edges of the search space, which is almost certainly a bogus
measurement. 


<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="config_path"><H3>CONFIG_PATH</H3></A><pre>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="point_method"><H3>POINT_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_method"><H3>MATCH_METHOD</H3></A><pre>
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="match_tol"><H3>MATCH_TOL</H3></A><pre>
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#match_method">MATCH_METHOD</A>=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nosite"><H3>NOSITE</H3></A><pre>
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="rsf"><H3>RSF</H3></A><pre>
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A>) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if &ltdir&gt is the name specified in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter, the following files will be searched for:

&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Master.svf
&ltdir&gt/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="debug_rsf"><H3>DEBUG_RSF</H3></A><pre>
If enabled, this causes the internal database of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rmc">RMC</A> locations to be
printed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#out">out</A> to the stdout log.  This is after the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord"><H3>COORD</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstie.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="coord_index"><H3>COORD_INDEX</H3></A><pre>
This parameter is ignored by marstie.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="fixed_site"><H3>FIXED_SITE</H3></A><pre>
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#fixed_site">FIXED_SITE</A> be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core5201/html/vichelp/marsautoloco_level2.html#rsf">RSF</A> parameter.
