The first file should contain the 10 TIR channels of MASTER image data,
calibrated in units of Watts per square meter per steradian per 
micrometer.  Note that these units are different from what the program
expected prior to November, 2004.

The second file should be the MASTER TIR radiance to temperature lookup 
table for the spectral response calibration that is in effect for the date
of data acquisition.  These files are typically located in the directory 

          $V2TOP/luts

and have names of the form

         lut.master.temp.YEAR.MON

The output dataset will contain surface kinetic temperature for each of the
10 input channels, assuming the emissivities supplied in the EMIS parameter.
Output pixels are real (32 bit floating point values), in units of degrees
Celsius.  Note that the pixel size and data scaling have changed from the
values in effect prior to November, 2004.

The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.

These are the spectral emissivity values assumed when computing the amount
of reflected downwelling radiance in the input, and when using the Planck
function to convert from radiance to temperature.  Ten values are required,
one for each MASTER channel from Channel 41 to 50.
