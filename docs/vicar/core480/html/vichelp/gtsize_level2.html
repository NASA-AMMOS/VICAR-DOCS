If two inputs are used then both must have GeoTIFF labels and
the mappings must be compatible for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> operation (only the
scale and offset can differ).

If a single input is used, then the GeoTIFF label is optional.

If the first input has a GeoTIFF label then a GeoTIFF label
will be computed for the output taking into account the
mapping, scale change, offset change, and (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#sl">SL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#ss">SS</A>) windowing.

In the simplest case of all, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> parameter is (1,1,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#nl">NL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#ns">NS</A>)
and no itie,otie is used.  The program magnifies/demagnifies
the image to fit the output (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#nl">NL</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#ns">NS</A>).  The effect is as
if the itie,otie was set to the outer corners of the outer
corner pixels.  The result will be the same as VICAR program
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>.

If a second input (GeoTIFF reference) is given, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A>
parameter is not used and an error occurs if it is given.

In all other cases, the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> parameter is a window on the
output grid determined by ITIE,OTIE.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> is defaulted,
then ITIE,OTIE must be given and the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> parameter will be
set to the smallest <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> to contain the "window" used by the
tiepoints.

For example, a standard case of a 5 x 5 image to a 10 x 15
image treating the pixels as "areas" of data would use

    itie=(0.5, 0.5,  5.5,  5.5)
    otie=(0.5, 0.5, 10.5, 15.5)
    
to treat the pixels as center points and map the same
image sizes as above would use
    
    itie=(1.0, 1.0,  5.0,  5.0)
    otie=(1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 15.0)

There are two types of zoom.

1.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#azoom">AZOOM</A> (area zoom) which fixes the corners of the corner 
    pixels and zooms the interval between them the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#azoom">AZOOM</A> value
    which can be any floating point number greater than 0.0.
    Note that an n x n image has distance n between the
    corners of the corner pixels and it is this distance that
    is zoomed.  So the total <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> of the image from corner (of 
    corner pixel) to corner is approximately <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#azoom">AZOOM</A>*n.  Fractional
    pixels may be discarded since the output image must be in
    whole pixels.  The scale change will be exactly <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#azoom">AZOOM</A> always.

2.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#pzoom">PZOOM</A> (point zoom) which fixes the centers of the corner 
    pixels and zooms the interval between them the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#pzoom">PZOOM</A> value
    which can be any floating point number greater than 0.0.
    Note that an n x n image has distance (n-1) between the
    centers of the corner pixels and it is this distance that
    is zoomed.  So the total <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> of the image from corner (of 
    corner pixel) to corner is <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#pzoom">PZOOM</A>*(n-1)+1 or the closest
    value to that if fractional pixels are involved.  The scale
    change will be exactly <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#pzoom">PZOOM</A> always. Using PZOOM=2.0 for a
    DTED image would cause the 601 x 1201 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> to become
    1201 x 2401.

In either case, a zoom of 2.0 approximately doubles the image
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> in pixels and a zoom of 0.5 halves the image size in pixels.
Both zooms preserve GeoTIFF label mappings.  The pixel scale is
always changed by an exact amount given by the zoom parameter,
to 15 decimal places.

A negative value of zoom is interpreted as -1/zoom, for example,
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#pzoom">pzoom</A>=-4 is the same as pzoom=0.25.

The two cases for this keyword are: COVERREF and COVERINP.

NORMAL CASE IS AS FOLLOWS ('COVERREF), ALSO THE DEFAULT

COVERREF means that the output will adjust to cover the
GeoTIFF reference image (the second input).  Both inputs
must have GeoTIFF labels and the geographic mappings must
agree.  The scales and offsets can differ.  The GeoTIFF 
mappings will be used to calculate all details of the
resize operation.  This option can be used to make a stack
of geographically identical images, all with the same (<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#nl">nl</A>,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#ns">ns</A>).

THE SECOND OPTION ('COVERINP) USEFUL FOR MOSAICKING AND DB

The other option (COVERINP) uses the reference image to
determine the mapping but ignores the reference image
frame.  It instead looks at the input image frame and
converts the entire input image.  Two things can still be
changed by this option:

    1.  The pixel "<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A>", actually, the ratio of mapping
	coordinates per pixel.  These ratios can be deter-
	mined by dividing the corner point coordinate
	difference by the number of pixels in the image.
	Horizontal and vertical are treated separately.
    2.  The pixel "shift".  Even if the pixel <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtsize_level2.html#size">size</A> for
	the two images agree, they may not mosaic together
	accurately because the pixel centers do not align.

Use of the typref parameter guarantees that both of these
problems will be corrected.  You can check this by looking
at the shifts written for each frame in FEATHER.  They should
all have a fraction of .000000 shown on their offsets.

Another example of this option ... the user can set up
an area or worldwide mapping by creating a GeoTIFF image
of a small subarea.  Other images can be put into a matching
raster grid by using the small area as a reference image.
The main effect will be to give the same scale and fractional
pixel offset so that tiles and mosaics will butt together
perfectly.
