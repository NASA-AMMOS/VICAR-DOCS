<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/trucolor.html">TRUCOLOR</A></H1>
<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
INP = (input1,...,inputN), where the inputs are up to ten 
images decalibrated by the program GALSOS.  The images must have been taken
with different filters and must all be the same size.

The input images should be reflectance images if the specified DEVICE is a film 
recorder, and radiance images if the specified DEVICE is a color monitor. 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
OUT = (redimage,greenimage,blueimage), where the outputs are image filenames 
to be used as inputs to the display device.
Outputs are always BYTE format.
There is an optional fourth output file containing a 2-d histogram of
the chromaticity space. See help file for specifics.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="colors"><H3>COLORS</H3></A><pre>
COLORS = (1,...,10), where the colors are up to 10 special 
colors.  There must be at least as many colors named as there are input images.
Eight valid colors have been defined for GLL, they have the names:
NAME     number       description                 comments
1/3        1       GLL bright red patch
1/12       2       GLL bright green patch
5/7        3       GLL bright blue patch
7/6        4       GLL dark blue patch
11/7       5       GLL darkest blue patch
desert     6       Earth desert yellow  
water      7       Earth ocean blue     
cloud      8       Earth clouds         
Tables of XYZ tristimulus values and response in both radiance and
reflectance for these 8 colors are built into the program already.
If you specify the XYZ and RADIANCE values by parameter input then
you need not specify special colors.
Example: colors=(3,4,5)

<hr>
<A NAME="conv"><H3>CONV</H3></A><pre>
CONV=(factor1,...,factorN), where each conversion factor corresponds to an 
input image (as they are ordered in INP).  CONV allows all input images to be
scaled in the same units, and should be the same as those specified in the
program GALSOS.  Each factor is multiplied by each pixel in the corresponding 
input image.  The number of factors specified must be at most equal to the 
number of inputs specified.
The default is to use CONV values in the picture labels.
Only used in the 'TV mode.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="iovf"><H3>IOVF</H3></A><pre>
IOVF=(factor1,...,factorN), where each conversion factor corresponds to an 
input image (as they are ordered in INP).  IOVF allows all input images to be
scaled in the same units, and should be the same as those specified in the
program GALSOS.  Each factor is multiplied by each pixel in the corresponding 
input image.  The number of factors specified must be at most equal to the 
number of inputs specified.
The default is to use IOVF values in the picture labels.
Only used in the 'FILM mode.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="filter"><H3>FILTER</H3></A><pre>
The GLL filter position numbers (0 to 7) for each of the input images
in the order of input. Defaults to the filter position in the image
label.
The first 5 special colors exist only for filters 1-3.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="xyz"><H3>XYZ</H3></A><pre>
Tristimulus values in the order X, Y, Z for each special color.
These offer a manual input. Usually they come from internal
tables pointed to by the COLORS keyword.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="response"><H3>RESPONSE</H3></A><pre>
The radiance or reflectance values for each special color and for
each filter position input. In the order of each input for the
first special color followed by the order of input for the second
color...
These offer a manual input. Usually they come from internal
tables pointed to by the COLORS keyword and the FILTER keyword.
The I/F and CONV values are included in the RESPONSE.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="device"><H3>DEVICE</H3></A><pre>
[DEVICE = imagedevice], where "imagedevice" specifies the device on which the 
output image files are to be displayed.  The only valid devices are 'TV 
(Conrac 7211) and 'FILM (MDA Color Fire). 

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="inc"><H3>INC</H3></A><pre>
The interval between lines and samples to skip in the initial pass
through the input data to obtain auto scaling.
Default is 10

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="noauto"><H3>NOAUTO</H3></A><pre>
To inhibit auto scaling of the Y tristimulus value. AUTO assures that
the full dynamic range of the display is utilized.
Defaults to 'AUTO

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nterms"><H3>NTERMS</H3></A><pre>
Number of terms to use in the polynomial fit connecting the Yxy 
values to DN . Can be 4 or 10. Defaults to 4. Do not try other than
the default value.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nfits"><H3>NFITS</H3></A><pre>
Number of points to use in the polynomial fit connecting Yxy to
DN. Can be from NTERMS+1 to 20. Defaults to 7. Do not use other than
the default.

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="illumin"><H3>ILLUMIN</H3></A><pre>
Illumination scaling factor. The DN*CONV or DN*I/F values used for the
special colors only can be multiplied by ILLUMIN to assist in 
controlling brightness. This only affects the least squares fits
relating special colors to tristimulus values.
You should not need to use this factor.
DEfaults to 1.0 .

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="macbeth"><H3>MACBETH</H3></A><pre>
Initiates an internal test of the program.
To use this test run the program as you would normally with images.
The output images should be ignored. Instead a printout of the
output dn values which correspond to 24 macbeth color patches will
be printed. Give these to Chris Capraro to load into the film
recorder to see how close the printed patches come to the desired
table of Yxy values.
