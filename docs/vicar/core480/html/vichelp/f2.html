<H1>Help for F2</H1>
<pre>
 PURPOSE:

 F2 allows general arithmetic operations to be performed on one to
 eighteen input images in either byte, halfword, fullword integer
 or fullword real formats (or any combination of these types).
 It now allows for arithmetic operations between three dimensional input files
 and can produce a three dimensional output.  All data organizations, BSQ, BIL,
 and BIP, are supported.  
 The arithmetic operation is specified by a FORTRAN or C-like expression
 which can include the following operators (synonyms connected by an =):
    
        + - * / ** unary-
	LOG   = ALOG    =  LN  (all these = natural (base e) log)
	LOG10 = ALOG10         (all these = common (base 10) log)
        SQRT   ABS   AINT = INT
        SIN    COS  TAN    ASIN  ACOS  ATAN  ATAN2
        AMAX1 = MAX  AMIN1 = MIN
        AMOD   MOD .AND.  .OR.  .XOR.  .NOT.
        .LT.  .LE. .EQ.   .NE.  .GT.  .GE.

 as well as the following C-operators:

  &    &&   |    ||    %   ^   !  
  ==   !=   &gt=   &lt=   >   <   >>   <<

 Operands to F2 can be :
	
	integers
	floating point numbers
	IN1	IN2	IN3	IN4  ...  IN18
	LINE 	SAMP    BAND

 The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#function">function</A> string can include constants, including constants expressed
 in floating point notation. The string can also include TCL variable 
 references.  
	
 F2 can operate on zero inputs to generate an output using the
 operands LINE, SAMP, and BAND.
 The current version of F2 has the following improvements over the 
 original (1976) version:

	1.  Allows up to 18 input files
	2.  Handles byte, halfword, fullword, or real input data files,
	    and allows mixed <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#format">format</A> cases.
	3.  Significant runtime speedups due to byte lookup tables
	    and implementation of new Vicar2 I/O.
        4.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#function">Function</A> string parameter expanded to a maximum of 250 characters.
	5.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#exclude">Exclude</A>, <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#limits">limits</A>, and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#replace">replace</A> parameter provided.
	6.  New KNUTH subroutines allow for C-Language constructs.
	7.  Unix-Compatible byte-order independent operation.
 F2 performs arithmetic operations on image files.  The program
 uses two library routines, KNUTH and XKNUTH, to compile and
 execute FORTRAN or C-like expressions entered by the parameters in the
 <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A> expression such as:
 	
  ((IN1+IN2)*(AINT(ALOG10(IN1*IN2**2))+3.14+IN1/22)+4*(LINE.EQ.SAMP)
 or:
  ((in1 + in2) % (3*(line!=samp))) &lt< 3 

 IN1 is an element from the first input and IN2 is the corresponding 
 element from the second input. KNUTH compiles the expression into 
 instructions executable by XKNUTH. The expression is applied to the
 pixels from  each input in XKNUTH to produce the output picture.  When
 performing  arithmetic, F2 converts all integer operands to real and
 executes  single precision floating point computations.  The exceptions
 are  the logical operators .AND.(&), .OR.(|), .XOR.(^), as well as the
 shift operators (&gt>) and (&lt<), all of which operate bitwise
 on  the 4-byte integer equivalent to the  truncated  floating point 
 number.  The final result from XKNUTH is converted back to integer by
 rounding,  which is  the default, or by truncation if '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#trunc">TRUNC</A> is specified.
 The logical values  'TRUE'  and  'FALSE' 
 when produced, are  interpreted as 1 and 0  respectively.  The logical NOT 
 operates only on the  values 0 and 1.

 Because of the type of calculations done on images, the routine XKNUTH
 is designed to never abort regardless of input values.  Illegal 
 operations result in the generation of a "reasonable" result as 
 follows: a) divide by zero causes divide by 1.E-6;  b) log of a
 negative number causes log its absolute value, etc.  The routine KNUTH 
 quits processing, prints an error message and returns if a syntax 
 error is detected in the expression string.  

 To conserve time, repetitive  executions of "F2" are  stored  as a 
 lookup table.  In the  cases  where both input and output are byte
 data,  the table is  construced  as a straight lookup initialized with
 every  possible  combination of  IN1  and IN2 from 1 to 256.  The table
 is  referenced by  indexing  the  array  using the concatenation of IN1
 and  IN2 to create  an index  number to  the vector table.  Table is 
 dimensioned 65536 to accommodate any possible combination of 256 x 256.
 For more information see KNUTH_LOOKUP.

 In cases which either the input or output is halfword data or  the
 inputs are small byte files, a hashing table is constructed.  The
 equation is then executed each time it encounters a unique
 combination of IN1 and IN2.  A key points to the storage location 
 of the results of XKNUTH.  The key is then determined by the 
 remainder of concatenating the two variables and dividing by 
 10909.  In case the key must be checked for a match of the 
 concatenation of IN1 and IN2 which was stored. If no key is  found,
 a solution is calculated and a concatenation of the result  of the
 XKNUTH calculation, IN1 and IN2 is stored. In cases which  the key
 points to an erroneous combination of IN1 and IN2, the  new values
 and the new key are stored. 

 If the operands LINE, SAMP, or BAND are used, no table is used and the
 formula is evaluated at every pixel. This option is also used on
 images involving fullword or real*4 length input or output, and 
 with multiple input files (3+).

 KNUTH compiles the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#function">function</A> expression into instructions that XKNUTH
 can execute.  For example, the expression "IN1*10+IN2" will be
 decomposed as
			LOAD 1
			MULT 22
			ADD  2
			RETN 0

 The IN1 thru IN18 are stored in location 1 thru 18, LINE, SAMP, and BAND
 are stored in later locations. Space is also separately reserved
 in the executable buffer for static constants, temporary registers
 and executable code. For more information, see KNUTH and XKNUTH.

 Produces a 100 x 100 x 100 halfword image with a diagonal in 3D of ones in a
 space of zeros.  In general, logical operators produce 0 for FALSE and 1 for 
 TRUE.
  
 RESTRICTIONS:
	
The program is restricted to lines of length 64000 pixels (byte <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#format">format</A>)
32000 pixels (halfword <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#format">format</A>), or 16000 pixels (real or fullword format).

The expression must not contain more than 30 constants, 20 variables, 
or roughly 80 operations.  Embedded blanks are allowed.
The expression is case insensitive.

If any of the input images have a (3-D) file organization other than BSQ,
then all of the input images must have the same file organization.

OPERATIONS:

When performing  arithmetic, F2 converts all integer
operands to real and executes  single precision floating point
computations.  The exception is  .AND., .OR., .XOR.,&gt> and &lt< which
operate on the binary equivalent of the  truncated floating
point number.  The final result from XKNUTH is converted back to integer by
rounding, which is the default, or by truncation if '<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#trunc">TRUNC</A> is specified.
The logical values "TRUE'  and 'FALSE' 
when produced, are interpreted as 1 and 0 respectively.
The logical NOT operates only on the logical values 0 and 1. 
A subtle consequence of converting integers to floating point is
that exponentiation does not work as expected for negative values
raised to an integer exponent.  This is because they are interpreted
as the absolute value raised to a floating point exponent.
Users should use ABS before exponentiation for even powers.  
Odd powers can be handled using
multiplication and the next smaller even power.

All operations now operate as in standard FORTRAN and C, including
MIN and MAX. When using the C operations "&" and "&&" recall that
VICAR interprets "&name" as a dereference operator on the variable
"name", so for bitwise AND put a space between args, e.g. "in1 & in2".
For logical AND you must actually use "in1 &&&& in2", because VICAR
interprets "&&" as an escaped single ampersand. When in doubt, use
the command .AND. instead.

 PRECISION: 
  The precision of values in fullword output images is limited to six
significant digits because F2 converts all numeric values to real <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#format">format</A>
before performing computations.  The variation in fullword values that
can be expected on different MIPS-supported machines shall not differ by 
more than 1 in six significant digits.  

 TIMING: 
  The following CPU times for a few F2 cases were obtained on a 
VAX 8650 (MIPL3) in July 1992.  
                                                CPU Time
gen f2a 2000 2000 'real
gen f2b 2000 2000 'real
f2 (f2a,f2b) x func="(in1+ in2)/2"              187s
f2 (f2a,f2b) x func="in1+3.7e+05 * in2"         171s
!
gen f2a 2000 2000 'byte
gen f2b 2000 2000 'byte
f2 (f2a,f2b) x                                   13.7s

For the case of a single BYTE or HALFWORD image, using program STRETCH
with the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/f2_level2.html#function">FUNCTION</A> parameter is at least twice as fast on the VAX as using 
the more general F2 program.
