<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
The file containing the bands of a calibrated radiance image, using the
WATTS units.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
     The first output dataset is a halfword image of all the input bands of
     emittance data, scaled such that an emittance of 1.0 is 10,000 DN.
     The second output dataset is a halfword temperature image, where each DN
     corresponds to 0.01 degree Celsius. 0 DN corresponds to 0 degrees C.

<A NAME="size"><H3>SIZE</H3></A><pre>
   The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will calibrate
   the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,638)

<p></pre>

<A NAME="sl"><H3>SL</H3></A><pre>
   Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).

<hr>
<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
   Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
   Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>
   Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).

<hr>
<A NAME="refchan"><H3>REFCHAN</H3></A><pre>
	The channel to which the other bands are to be referenced, in
	the case of REFCHAN mode, is input through this parameter.
	In  BBFIT and ALPHA modes, this parameter is ignored.
		Example: REFCHAN = 5

<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="e"><H3>E</H3></A><pre>
     In REFCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the reference channel is
     set to a constant value, given by this parameter.
     In BBFIT mode, spectral emittances are computed so that the maximum
     of the six emittance values is equal to the value of E.

<A NAME="date"><H3>DATE</H3></A><pre>
        TEMIS needs the center wavelength for each band of the input. The
        Variables CWAVE, FILFILE or DATE are used to specify those wavelengths.
        Only one of the three variable should be specified

        CWAVE is an array of the center wavelengths (nicrons) that
           corresponds to the bands of the input file (in micron

        FILFILE is an ascii file that contains one filter function for
           each input band. each filter is started by a line containing
           the string " band" and should consist of two columns, the first
           the wavelength in microns and the second the response at that
           wavelength

        DATE is the TIMS flightline date for the case of TIMS data. TEMIS
           will retreive the filter funtion from timsfilt subroutine.

        if none of these three parameters is specified, TEMIS looks in the
        label for a TIMS format date, and if it finds one, retreives the
        filter from the timsfilt subroutine.

     An example of a filter file would be:

 band 1
  0.52  0.2 
  0.56  1.0 
  0.60  0.3
 band 2
  0.63 0.2
  0.66 1.0
  0.69 0.2
 band 3
  0.76 0.5  
  0.77 0.5

<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
     Three algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first
   method, called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified
   constant emittance value. The default sets Channel 6 to 0.95. The
   temperature is computed based upon the radiance and given emittance of
   the reference channel, then the other five spectral emittances are
   computed, using this temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
   emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes
   the highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the six
   spectral emittances, based upon the computed temperature.
     The thrid method is the aplha residuals method.
     The fourth method is to calculate the brightness temperature for each
   band.
