PURPOSE:
concompi uses connectivity defined by adjacency (not diagonal) of pixels
to turn an image into a connected component image.  Each connected
component receives a unique pixel number.  The input and output must be
halfword or fullword.

This version of the concomp program has an additional image input.  The
values in this image are treated as a boolean (0=false, non-0=true) and
only components that intersect or touch a true value are kept in the
output.  All other components are zero'd.  The components that are kept
are resequenced 1..n.

The highest numbered component can be output to a tcl variable named
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concompi_level2.html#lastcmp">LASTCMP</A>.  The component numbering can also be started at a user selected
number with the parm <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concompi_level2.html#startcmp">STARTCMP</A>.

EXECUTION:

Example

concompi (A,C) (B,WORK)      The image A will be turned into connected 
                        components in image B, but only components that
                        touch a non-0 value in C will be kept.  The WORK
                        image is needed for calcualtions and can be deleted.
