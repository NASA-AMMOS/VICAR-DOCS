The input data are in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format; i.e. the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> are appended together
in the sample direction using the program <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>.  The pixels can be in any
format since they are converted to real in the program.  The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> parameter 
specifies how many <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> are in the input file.

    The first output file is a statistics dataset (like those produced by 
USTATS, etc)  which contains the number of data points, the mean vector, 
and the covariance matrix for each cluster. 
 
    The second output file is intended for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A> option.  It contains 
the input data for those <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> that were used in the clustering and another 
band which gives the cluster number that the pixel was assigned to.  This 
file is in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format and has the same pixel format as the input file.  If 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> and/or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#incr">INCR</A> was specified on the first run, then the data will have 
been compressed accordingly and these parameters must not be respecified on 
a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">restart</A>.

<hr>
<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
Starting sample.  This is PER BAND, i.e., it does not apply (as is standard
for the MIPL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ss">SS</A> parameter) to the entire input image, but (because the image
is in this case in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format) to each band separately.
<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>
Number of samples.  This is PER BAND, i.e., it does not apply (as is standard
for the MIPL <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ns">NS</A> parameter) to the entire input image, but (because the image
is in this case in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> format) to each band separately.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="mss"><H3>MSS</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> parameter specifies how many <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> are in the input MSS
format file.  
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="bands"><H3>BANDS</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A> parameter specifies which bands in the input file will be
used for the clustering.  This allows the user to try clustering various
combinations of <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> without having to make up a new input dataset each
time.  There must be at least two, but no more than twelve <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A>.

Default is to use all <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> in the input file in the order in which they
occur in the file.  However, if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A> has been specified, then the last
band is not used.  I.e., default is:
  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A> = (1,2,...,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>)  if not <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A>,
  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">BANDS</A> = (1,2,...,<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A>-1)  if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A>.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="incr"><H3>INCR</H3></A><pre>
Increment in line and sample direction.  This parameter specifies both
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#linc">LINC</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#sinc">SINC</A>, q.v.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="linc"><H3>LINC</H3></A><pre>
Increment in the line direction.  This parameter specifies that only
every LINCth line (starting with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#sl">SL</A>) will be used to select objects from
the image for the algorithm.

Default = 1 (every line).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sinc"><H3>SINC</H3></A><pre>
Increment in the sample direction.  This parameter specifies that only
every SINCth sample (starting with <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ss">SS</A>) will be used to select objects from
the image for the algorithm.

Default = 1 (every sample).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="thresh"><H3>THRESH</H3></A><pre>
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> specifies the minimum DN value that is to be accepted as a valid
pixel.  If an object has a DN less than <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> in any band (of those 
specified by the BAND parameter), then it is rejected.

The default is to not do thresholding; all pixels in <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">size</A> region are used.

In the second output file, all pixels on a given line that have been rejected
are written at the end of that line, with 0 DN.  Hence <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> does not need 
to be specified on a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A>, even if it was specified on the first run.

<hr>
<A NAME="nclus"><H3>NCLUS</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#nclus">NCLUS</A> parameter guides the algorithm in choosing the number of 
clusters (see theory of operation).  The first number is the desired number
of clusters and the second number is about how many clusters the algorithm
can stray from the desired number.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ncycle"><H3>NCYCLE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#ncycle">NCYCLE</A> parameter is the maximum number of temperature cycles the 
algorithm will perform.  If it is large then the algorithm will lower the
temperature very slowly, but if it is too small the system will be
quenched and will not be at a true minimum energy configuration.
The default will usually be adequate.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="niter"><H3>NITER</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#niter">NITER</A> parameter specifies how many iterations are to be done for
each cooling cycle.  The default is to do 4 times the number of data points,
so that on average each point will be considered about four times per
cycle.  The default will usually be adequate.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="temp"><H3>TEMP</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#temp">TEMP</A> parameter gives the initial temperature to start the system
off with.  The initial temperature should be of the order of unity.
A higher starting temperature will make the system behave more randomly
at first.  The default will usually be adequate.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="restart"><H3>RESTART</H3></A><pre>
To <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">restart</A> the run, the RESTART keyword is specified and the second output 
file from the previous run is used for the input file.  Note that the 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#bands">bands</A> in the new input file are in different positions than the bands in 
the old input file and the input includes an additional band containing
cluster numbers, hence <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#mss">MSS</A> will in general be different than on the first
run.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#incr">INCR</A> (or equivalent parameters) were specified in the 
first run they must not be specified on a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/clusan_level2.html#restart">RESTART</A>, as the data will have 
been compressed accordingly.
