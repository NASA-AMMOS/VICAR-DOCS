PURPOSE:
 
   HYPERFIX is a VICAR procedure to correct for the misregistration of
the SWIR bands in HYPERION image data. It assumes that all SWIR channels
(Channels 71 - 242) are misregistered 1.0 pixel to the right, and the up-down
misregistration varies in evenly spaced increments from 0.5 pixels down for
Channel 71, to 1.0 pixels up for Channel 242.
 
EXECUTION:
 
   The following is the execution statement format for HYPERFIX:
 
		HYPERFIX INP OUT PARAMS
 
   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their respective
parameter sections. 
OPERATION:
 
   HYPERFIX copies the input file into the output file, then for each of
Bands 71 through 242, it creates a rectification image using GEN and TRAN,
performs a registration using TGEOM2, and replaces that band into the output 
file, using INSERT3D.

   The user may process a subset of the image in the line direction, by
using the SL and NL parameters.  The last sample (256) is removed from
the output image, since there are no corresponding pixels to this sample in
the SWIR bands.  Otherwise, no subsetting is permitted in the sample direction.

   Since INSERT3D requires the input file to be in BSQ format, the input
to HYPERFIX must also be in BSQ format.
