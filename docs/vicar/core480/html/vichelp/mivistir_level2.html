<A NAME="inp"><H3>INP</H3></A>
<pre>
The first file should contain the 10 channels of MIVIS TIR image data,
calibrated as bightness temperature at sensor, in units of degrees Celsius
multiplied by 10.0.

The second file should be the MIVIS TIR calibration file (in VICAR format)
that is in effect for the date of data acquisition.

The third file should be the MIVIS TIR radiance lookup table file (in VICAR 
format) that is in effect for the date of data acquisition.
<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="out"><H3>OUT</H3></A><pre>
The output dataset will contain upwelling radiance at surface data for the
ten MASTER TIR channels, in units of milliWatts per sqare meter per steradian 
per micrometer.  Output pixels are halfword (16 bit signed integer).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="size"><H3>SIZE</H3></A><pre>
The standard VICAR output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,755)
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="sl"><H3>SL</H3></A><pre>
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ss"><H3>SS</H3></A><pre>
Starting sample and number of samples are ignored.  The entire width of the
input image is always processed.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="nl"><H3>NL</H3></A><pre>
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="ns"><H3>NS</H3></A><pre>
Starting sample and number of samples are ignored.  The entire width of the
input image is always processed.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modinp"><H3>MODINP</H3></A><pre>
   The atmospheric and geometric parameters needed by this program to run
   MODTRAN are supplied by the user providing a valid MODTRAN input (TAPE5)
   file.  This file may be generated by the stand alone program "modin",
   or by any other means convenient to the user.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modout"><H3>MODOUT</H3></A><pre>
   As a default, the report file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODOUT, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.
<p>
<p></pre>


<hr>
<A NAME="modtab"><H3>MODTAB</H3></A><pre>
   As a default, the tabular file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODTAB, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.
