<H1>Level 2 Help for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1.html">CONCOMP1</A></H1>
<A NAME="thresh"><H3>THRESH</H3></A>
<pre>
In order to determine which DNs to change, concomp1 applies a test to each
pixel in the input image.  The test involves looking at a 3 by 3 (pixel) window
centered around the pixel being tested. The number of OTHER pixels in the
window with the same value is the 'connectivity factor'.  If the connectivity
factor is less than the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> parameter, the central pixel is replaced either
by a user specified value or by the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">mode</A> of the distribution within the window.
The default value for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#thresh">THRESH</A> is 1.  Valid values for THRESH are integers from
0 to 8, inclusive.

<A NAME="replace"><H3>REPLACE</H3></A><pre>
Specify either <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> as the method for determining the new DN value 
for pixels that are to be replaced.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> is specified, the new value 
is just the value specified for the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> parameter.  The default value
for <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> is 255.  This default is used if neither REPLACE or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is
specified.

<A NAME="mode"><H3>MODE</H3></A><pre>
Specify either <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> or <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> as the method for determining the new DN value
for pixels that are to be replaced.  If <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is specified, the new value is
generally the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">mode</A> of the DN distribution within the window.  More precisely,
if <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is specified, the new DN is the most frequent DN in the window that
lies in the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">range</A> of DNs specified for the RANGE parameter.  In case of a tie
in determining the most frequent DN, the lowest of the DNs in the tie is used. 
If no DN in the specified <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">range</A> occurs in the window, the DN of the pixel
tested is not changed.  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#replace">REPLACE</A> is the default.

<A NAME="range"><H3>RANGE</H3></A><pre>
The <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">RANGE</A> parameter is used only when <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#mode">MODE</A> is selected. This parameter is
entered in the form <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>=(LO,HI) where LO and HI are selected by the user. 
This defines a <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">range</A> from a DN of LO to a DN of HI, inclusive.  When a pixel is
changed, the new DN is the most frequent DN in the window that lies in the
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">range</A> of DNs specified for the RANGE parameter. The range is commonly set
according to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">range</A> of DNs for the regions of the image.  The range should
be made as small as the input image allows in order to reduce execution time. 
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/concomp1_level2.html#range">RANGE</A>=(0,255) is the default.
