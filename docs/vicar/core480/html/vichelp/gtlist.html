PURPOSE
     GTLIST is a VICAR applications program which lists information
     in a VICAR GeoTIFF label.  Besides listing the label contents,
     derived information about the corner point coordinates and the
     image rotation are calculated.
     
     A non-image GeoTIFF file can also be listed by this program,
     but information about the corner points is omitted.
    	
CALL
     gtform <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#inp">INP</A> PARAMS
  WHERE:
     <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#inp">INP</A>            is the input data set.
     PARAMS         is a standard VICAR parameter field.
OPERATION

GTLIST reads the GeoTIFF label and the VICAR NL,NS parameters.  The
printout is based on these.  Note that the GeoTIFF image coordinate
system will differ systematically from the VICAR image coordinate
(line,sample) system by a half a pixel or a whole pixel (depending 
on whether the GeoTIFF file is "area" format or "post" format.  An
example of a "post" formatted file is DMA DTED -- there is an
elevation reading exactly at the initial lon-lat.

If the GeoTIFF label is not attached to a VICAR image, the raster
coordinates are applied to an hypothetical 1000 x 2000 image to help
the user understand the mapping.  If the label does not contain raster
coordinates (for example, just a map spec), then the label will simply
be listed.  The user can input another hypothetical size using the
parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#listnl">LISTNL</A> and <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#listns">LISTNS</A>.  These values enter into the map
scale calculation as well.

In addition, rotation is explained.  Rotation refers to the order
of pixels in the file.  The eight possible rotation are (here, pixel
value represents the order of data in the file):

   369    123    741    987
0: 258 1: 456 2: 852 3: 654
   147    789    963    321

   963    789    147    321
4: 852 5: 456 6: 258 7: 654
   741    123    369    987

Rotation 1 is the VICAR standard rotation.  It is used also by
systems such as LAS, IDIMS, LARSYS, ERDAS, I2S, etc. and was
adopted by LANDSAT, SPOT, and all of the planetary probes.
It is also produced by frame grabbers since it is the
ordering of a TV scan.  Rotation 0 is the USGS standard and is
used, for example, for DMA DTED.

The fact that an image is "rotated" is due to the different ways
that line-sample ordering can represent a geographic east-north
coordinate system.


The transitions among these rotations are given by the
following table:

	   no flip              flip

rotate-&gt0  90 180 270      0  90 180 270

   0)   0   3   2   1      4   5   6   7
   1)   1   0   3   2      5   6   7   4
   2)   2   1   0   3      6   7   4   5
   3)   3   2   1   0      7   4   5   6
   4)   4   5   6   7      0   3   2   1
   5)   5   6   7   4      1   0   3   2
   6)   6   7   4   5      2   1   0   3
   7)   7   4   5   6      3   2   1   0


VICAR can process images with any rotation (basically by ignoring
the fact that rotation means anything).  The exception would be
for programs that combine images such as F2, OVERLAY, APPEND, MSS,
FASTMOS, etc.  These correctly operate only when the images have
the same rotation.

Map scale is printed out, but this depends upon the display inches
and map unit size in meters.  The parameters <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#mapinch">MAPINCH</A> AND <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/gtlist_level2.html#mapunitm">MAPUNITM</A>
are provided for inutting these values.
