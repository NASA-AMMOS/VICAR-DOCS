     The user can choose whether the output is the same size
     as the input, or is reduced in size to barely contain 
     the polygon.  The latter case has two features:
     
     1.  A geotiff label is updated for the reduced image.
     2.  The starting (line,samp) of the reduced image in
         the original image can be output to TCL variables.
