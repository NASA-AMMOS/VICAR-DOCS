<pre>
This PDF-file was developed in order to provide various sub-PDF's which can
be used by Menu-driven PDF's (i.e. so-called MDF's).
This sub-PDF is the entry point which is selected to execute the program.
There are no parameters to specify. 

OPERATION:

'common_proc_done' calls the main-PDF with the option 
"readparam=read" which is needed to make sure that main_PDF reads (restores) 
all parameter files which have been created and saved by 
the previous calls to the separate PDF's. Finally, the main-PDF calls 
the main application pogram .
