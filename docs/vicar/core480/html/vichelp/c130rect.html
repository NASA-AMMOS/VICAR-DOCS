<H1>Help for C130RECT</H1>
<pre>
PURPOSE:
C130RECT removes panorama distortion in images acquired by scanners that
sample at equal angular increments. <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#tilt">Tilt</A> can be corrected and the aspect 
ratio of the image can be adjusted.
 
EXECUTION:
 
Example 
	C130RECT  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#inp">INP</A>  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#out">OUT</A>  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#defl">DEFL</A>=30.0  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#tilt">TILT</A>=11.4  <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#scale">SCALE</A>=1.5
 
	In this example, C130RECT will remove the scanning distortion
	in image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#inp">INP</A>, using a 30 degree deflection from edge to center,
        an expansion factor of 1.5, and a center 11.4 degrees off nadir.
 
 
OPERATION:
The program is essentially divided into three parts.  The first of these
handles simple initialization and computes (using basic trigonometry) 
values for the variables which are dependent on the image <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#tilt">tilt</A> and scan
width.  The second part of the program fills a resampling address array
which, for each input pixel position, gives a real-valued index into
the input buffer from which values may be interpolated; this array mapping
may be dumped to the screen by specifying the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#debug">DEBUG</A> option.  The third part
of the program reads in each line of the image, and using the resampling
address array and c routine resamp, corrects each line for distortion
according to the <A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/vicar/core480/html/vichelp/c130rect_level2.html#tilt">tilt</A> and scan width specified, finally outputing each 
line to the output image.
