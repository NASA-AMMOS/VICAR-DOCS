<A NAME="1.1">
<H2>1.1	Document Purpose</H2>
</A>

The VICAR User's Guide  is designed to instruct the new user in the
use of the VICAR (Video Image Communication and Retrieval) image 
processing system and to serve as a reference manual for the 
experienced user.<P>

This document is a facility-independent guide to both the UNIX and
VAX/VMS implementations of the VICAR system.  Basic knowledge of UNIX
and VAX/VMS is assumed.<P>

The most important and useful user information has been gleaned from
several sources, enhanced and incorporated into this document.  The
VICAR User's Guide does not replace these sources, but provides the
central focus of user documentation.<P>

<A NAME="1.2">
<H2>1.2	Document Organization</H2>
</A>

This document has been divided into eleven sections which introduce
the VICAR system and describe its use.<P>

<OL>

<LI> Introduction, purpose and organization of the document; document
conventions

<LI> User documentation and references

<LI> VICAR history, applications and acquisition 

<LI> Basic VICAR concepts: entering and exiting VICAR; datasets;
labels; procs

<LI> The VICAR environment: libraries; processing modes; subprocesses;
aborting commands

<LI> Methods for obtaining Help; Tutor and Menu modes; explanation of
how to interpret messages

<LI> Use of the VICAR executive: TAE Command Language; VICAR command
structure; Proc Definition Files; media handling; session logging

<LI> Non-standard and non-VICAR topics: hardware and software
assumptions that apply to a subset of the VICAR applications software;
VICAR I/O formats

<LI> Advanced VICAR concepts: dataset and label structure

<LI> Appendices: VICAR application proc functional descriptions and
classification by function; Intrinsic commands; command qualifiers;
intrinsic global variables; Menu and Tutor mode user operations;
special terminal keys; Proc Definition File examples; VICAR label
examples; VICAR message interpretation; New User's Tutorial, VICAR
Sample Session

<A NAME="1.3">
<H2>1.3	Conventions, Acronyms and Terms</H2>
</A>

<A NAME="1.3.1">
<H3>1.3.1 Conventions</H3>
</A>

Several conventions are utilized throughout this document to ensure
ease and consistency of interpretation.<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG> is the VICAR prompt.<P>

<LI>Double quotes, " ", are used around special characters or
technical terms to avoid confusion with everyday meanings (i.e., "*"
and "help"). <P>

<LI>Vertical dots indicate that not all of the required data are
shown. <P>

<EM>Example:</EM>  Use of vertical dots. <P>

<PRE>
    Process HELP=help-location
    Parm  name1  Description1
    Parm  name2  Description2
    .
    .
    .
    End-proc
</PRE><P>

<LI>Since VICAR makes no distinction between upper and lower case for
user input, both are used in examples. (Note: On UNIX systems,
filenames are still case sensitive, so "<CODE>out.img</CODE>" is a
different file from "<CODE>OUT.IMG</CODE>".) <P>

<LI>In all examples of user input in this document, VICAR
responses are in bold-faced type and user-typed text is not. <P>

<LI>Brackets, [ ], are used to represent optional entries. <P>

<I>Example:</I><P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG> program [<VAR>parameters</VAR>]
</PRE><P>

<LI>Commands that can be abbreviated are shown with sqare
brackets. The brackets indicate which letters do not need to be
included as part of the command (i.e., <CODE>ALLO[C]</CODE> can be 
<CODE>ALLOC</CODE> or <CODE>ALLO</CODE>). <P>

<LI>In order to make it possible for both new and experienced
users to benefit from this document, the following words in boldfaced
type are used to designate material that is for more advanced users.
<P> 

When <STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> appears at the beginning of a
paragraph it warns the new user that this is difficult material and
should be skipped. <P>

Material "for wizards only" is flagged by <STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> and should be
avoided by all but the very brave. <P>

<LI>Warnings to users regarding hazardous use of commands or
potentially dangerous situations are <EM>italicized</EM> and are flagged
by <STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG>. <P>

<LI>USERID is used to represent the user's login id.
