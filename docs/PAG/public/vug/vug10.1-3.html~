<H2>10.2 Classification of VICAR  Procs by Function</H2>
</A>

A major strength of the VICAR system is the flexibility of its
software set.  This feature, however, makes clear classification of
procs by function a difficult task.  Many procs have a primary
function, but may perform other secondary tasks that may also be
useful.  For example, the proc AMOS performs planetary navigation, but
its main function is atmospheric motion analysis.  Therefore, in the
lists that follow, proc names in uppercase denote the primary
function, and those in lowercase denote a secondary function. <P>

<H2>10.3 Standard VICAR Procs and their Functions</H2>
</A>

Certain VICAR procs make use of facility-specific or propietary
hardware devices or software packages.  The lack of these resources
may cause a given proc to fail.  Procs with this characteristic are
denoted in this section by symbols in the NOTE column.  "Required"
means that the proc will not function without the indicated resource.
"May be required" means that the proc is probably a procedure which
will call one program if the resource is available and another if it
is not.  <P>

Also included in the NOTE column is an indication of the whether or
not the proc has been ported to UNIX yet, or whether a proc is
obsolete.  (Obsolete programs may still be available, but are no
longer supported.) <P>

The symbols in the column "NOTE" are: <P>

<STRONG>VICAR
PROC	  NOTE	FUNCTION</STRONG>

ABLE86	   OX	Extracts data from the Galileo SSI flight and 
		ground calibration labels.
ADDON      OX	Advances a tape to the end of the last file or 
		to a position after any given number of files. 
ADESPIKE 	Detects pixel spikes and removes them by 
		averaging adjacent pixels. Single missing lines 
		are also filled in. 
ADL	   OU	Adds a line to an image by adding a constant 
		value to pixels specified by endpoints.  
AFEWCLOG   OX	Reads the Air Force Electronic Warfare Center 
		digital terrain database and produces VICAR 
		images. 
AGGRG	   OU	IBIS program aggregating columns of numbers 
		using any designated column of the file as a 
		control column.   
AGGRG2	   OU	IBIS program collapsing columns of numbers in 
		an interface file into smaller columns using 
		a designated column as the control.  
AL	    U	Allocates disk image files.
ALLOC       X  	Allocates a tape drive to the user.
ALT_DAILY   X	Processes a nominal set of 7 consecutive orbits
		of ALT-EDR data from one input tape into 7
		BADRS. 
ALTSIM      X	Generates the orbital intermediate files for 
		MIPL-MGN processing of altimetric/radiometric
		data.
AMOS   	  DIU  	Interactive program supporting Atmospheric 
		MOtion Studies on Voyager and Galileo images.  
ANNOT       U	Accesses the britton-lee database and returns
		the database output to a file specified by	
		the parameter ANN_FILE.
APFLAG	   AU  	Returns into local variables the array processor 
		availability, format and size of an input image. 
APODIZE	   OU	Modifies picture borders so that the Fourier 
		transform will be free from spikes through the 
		zero frequency axis, allowing filters to operate 
		without ringing on the edge of an image.   
APPEND	   OU	Concatenates up to 30 images vertically.
ARCDR_GEN   X	Makes the OHFnnnnn.LBL, EPFnnnnn.LBL,
		ADFnnnnn.LBL, RDFnnnnn.LBL and ACONTENT.TAB 
		files for the ARCDR CD-ROMs.
ARCHIVE     X	Creates the ancillary file of all archival
		products from the MIPL/MAGELLAN systematic 
		stream.
ARDREC     OX	Corrects aircraft line scanner imagery for 
		relief displacement using digital elevation 
		(DEM) data.  
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/~pma/vicarhlp/astrtchr_description.html">ASTRTCHR</A>	Performs automatic linear stretches on fullword
		floating point or integer images.   
AUTOMATCH   U	A program which automatically acquires tiepoints
		from sets of images for the purpose of producing
		mosaics.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/~pma/vicarhlp/average_description.html">AVERAGE</A>		Averages up to 48 separate images into one 
		image.
AVHRRLOG   OX	Logs NOAA AVHRR data from tape into VICAR 
		format.
<A HREF="/VICAR-DOCS/~pma/vicarhlp/badlabels_description.html">BADLABELS</A>	Determines the "Bad Data Values" for an input 
		GLL SSI UDR.  Optionally, it will also cal-
		culate the entropy of the image.
BADR_ARCH   X	Archives BADRs onto magnetic tape and optical
		 disk.
BADRLOG     X	An ALT-DAILY internal process which takes the 
		BADR data records created by RCBR and forms
		BADR orbital files which will be run into BIN
		to make the GADR.
BADSHOW     U	Prints or displays the bad data values in an 
		image.
BADRSIM     X	Generates the basic altimeter data record files
		for MIPL-MGN processing of altimetric data.
