4.1	Introduction
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This
Section contains a programmer's guide for reading, adding, and deleting items
in an image file label. A label describes the size, nature, processing history,
origin and attributes of an associated image file. When an image is generated
as an output file by an image processing task, the Executive will create an
output label, combining items in the input file label with new label
information derived from the current processing function. In this way, a
history of the processing of the data contained in the output file will be
maintained. In addition, the Executive will guarantee that required label
information, such as the output image size, will be correctly produced. The
user and owner of a file may also modify the label of that file from the
command language. 
<BR>
A
programmer may modify the label of any file that is written or updated by a
program. The routines described in this Section permit the programmer to make
such modifications.

4.1.1	A
Label Model
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A
label is composed of label items. A label item is a text key word of 32
character maximum size that identifies the label item, and a value which is the
information part of the label item. A value may be multi-valued, that is,
contain more than one value. As an example, a label item for an image file may
be the dimension of the image, comprised of a key word DIM, and a value, 3. For
another example, consider as a label item the image size. The key word might be
SIZE, and the value, (800,800,3). This label item is multi-valued. 
<BR>
The
set of keyword-value label items that comprise a label is considered by the
executive to be partitioned into three sets of items, the system, history and
property. The system items consist of those items that are independent of the
history of the file. These items will include the size of the image, its
organization, its pixel format, and the blocksize. 
<BR>
The
organization of the label into system, history and property, and the further
breakdown of the history into subsets based on processing task reflects the
model of the image label that programmers have found to be convenient at MIPL. 
<BR>
System
labels are defined by the VICAR RTL and contain all the information necessary
for the RTL to access the image, such as size, pixel type, and host format
information. System label items are not normally modified once the image is
created. Since they are defined by the RTL, application programmers may not add
their own system label items. 
<BR>
History
labels contain the processing history of the image. Each time a VICAR task is
run on an image, a new history task gets added to the history label of the
image. The history labels are copied from the &#8220;primary input&#8221; file
(usually the first input file), and the new task is appended to the end.
Application programs are free to add label items as they wish to the history
label. 
<BR>
Property
labels are used to describe the current state (or properties) of the image.
They should eventually take over that function from the history labels, leaving
the history labels to be 
<I>only
</I>history.
This may take a while, due to the large amount of software and images that use
the history labels, but the goal is to make property labels the only place for
non-historical image labels. 
<BR>
Property
labels are divided into named groups or sets called 
<I>properties</I>,
much like history labels are divided into named groups called 
<I>tasks</I>.
There is only one instance of each property name, unlike history tasks. For
example, while there may be a half dozen LOGMOS tasks in the history label,
there could be only one MIDR property in the property label. 
<BR>
Within
each property group are individual label items. The label items look identical
to their counterparts in the system and history labels. They may be string,
integer, real, or double precision, and may have multiple values (i.e. an
array). The keys for each label item must be unique within the property group,
but may be duplicated between groups. The keys can be up to 32 characters long,
just like any other label key. The label keys PROPERTY and TASK are reserved to
separate property and history label sets, and may not be used by applications. 
<BR>
An
example property label is listed (via 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">label-list</FONT></TT>)
below. The properties and names listed are examples, not official names.

4.1.2	Property
Labels
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before
property labels were introduced, history labels served a dual role: they
contained processing history (which tasks were run in what order) along with
information about the image&#8217;s current state. A good example is the
Magellan MIDR label. All descriptive information about the MIDR product is kept
by convention in the first LOGMOS history task. They have no historical meaning
whatsoever, as they are updated by later processing runs. They describe the
current state of the image.
<BR>
Another
example is map labels, which describe the image&#8217;s map projectio. A
program that changes the projection adds a new map label entry to the history
label. The last entry is the current projection. While in this case the map
labels are historical, it is confusing to search through all the map labels to
find the last (current) one. It is useful to keep a history of previous
projections, but it is not clear to an inexperienced user which projection is
current. 
<BR>
This
dual role for history labels was confusing. Which of potentially several LOGMOS
runs were the MIDR labels kept in? What task created the map labels? What was
the actual processing history ? Since previous tasks were modified, some
historical information was lost. These problems led to the creation of property
labels. 
<BR>
Property
labels are used in place of binary labels for most applications. Property
labels do not suffer the same portability problems as binary labels, and may be
written and read by standard VICAR RTL routines. They replace binary headers in
most cases. Replacing binary prefixes may be more difficult. Although binary
labels are still allowed replacing them with property labels is strongly
encouraged.

4.1.2.1	Using
Property Labels 
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Property
labels are accessed in much the same way that history labels are. The routines
<B>
x/zladd
</B>,<B>
x/zldel
</B>,<B>
x/zlget
</B>,
and
<B>
x/zlinfo
</B>
have been modified to accept &#8220;PROPERTY&#8221; for the 
<I>type</I>
argument, as well as &#8220;SYSTEM&#8221; and &#8220;HISTORY&#8221;. Specify
which property the label belongs to via the &#8220;PROPERTY&#8221; optional
argument to these routines. Like history labels, property labels may have
multiple instances, accessed through the &#8220;INSTANCE&#8221; keyword. The
&#8220;HIST&#8221; key word is not used for property labels. In addition, a new
routine, 
<B>x/zlpinfo</B>,
has been added to get a list of properties in the label, similar to 
<B>x/zlhinfo</B>.
<BR>
Internally,
property labels are stored in between the system and history labels. A property
set starts with a 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">PROPERTY=</FONT></TT><I>property-name</I>,
label item, followed by all labels for that property. The property ends at the
next PROPERTY key word or at the start of the history labels (indicated by a
TASK key word). 
<BR>
Properties
appear automatically when a label item for that property is added. There is no
explicit creation step to add a new property; just add a label item in that
property and it will be created with an instance number of 1. The same is not
true for deletion (via the RTL): if you want to delete an entire property
delete all the elements from it and then delete the PROPERTY marker (using
PROPERTY as the key word to delete from the property set). The 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">label-delete</FONT></TT>
program can do this. It is important to that this is exactly the way history
labels work: tasks are created automatically when programs are run, but to
delete a task delete all the key words for that task, including the marker
labels (TASK, DAT_TIM, and USER). 
<BR>
Property
labels, like history labels, are automatically copied from the primary input
file to the output file. This is done because most properties will not change
in a typical program run. Programs should update any properties that do
change,. The copying of property labels can be controlled via 
<B>x/zvselpi</B>
which allows you to change the source for the primary input file.
<BR>
If
you are implementing something new, like a look-up table or a new flight label,
then you can use the property labels without problem. However, if you are
moving an image that used to use history labels to the property label, like the
map projection or an old flight label, you have to make sure that you can read
files with the information either in the property label or in the history
label. Old images with the information in the history label exist and will be
used. For this case, you might want to adopt a similar strategy to the reading
of other host's data: read the label from either the property or history label
(wherever it is), but only write out property labels.

4.1.2.2	Property
Instance Numbers
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Properties
record the current state of an image, while history labels record the
operations that have been performed on an image. Property instances are used
when multiple &#8220;current states" are valid. For example, when different
methods may be used for to generate pointing correction, or different people do
this manually, different pointing corrections will be obtained.  These
corrections are all valid for their intended use; since there is no way to
determine the correct pointing, they are all simultaneously valid. Each
pointing correction is stored as an instance of a single property.
<BR>
There
is no change to the label format in the file; a property instance is just
another property set with the same name as a previous instance.  There is no
explicit identifier in the label.  We suggest that you create a special label
item in each multi-instance property type that identifies the type. Then you
have two choices for finding a specific instance of a property. You can use 
<I>
</I><B>x/zlpinfo</B>
to get a list, then cycle through all the instances of the property you care
about, looking for the special label item. The alternative is to use 
<B>x/zlget</B>
on the identifier for the property in question, incrementing the instance
number until an error is returned, indicating that no more instances of this
property exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="Heading60"></A><H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
4.1.2.3	Property
Names 
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
RTL does no error or valid value checking on the name of a property, other than
to ensure that it is 32 characters or less and is composed of printable ASCII
characters. Any name at all can be used as a property name. However, there must
be some control over property names, and the items that go in the property, or
chaos will result. 
<BR>
It
is up to the application programmer community to define how the property labels
will be used, what they will be called, and what will go in them. The property
name should be a short description of what the property is. For example, good
names might be MAP, LUT, GLL-SSI, MGN-MIDR, or VIEWING-GEOMETRY (these
examples, not official names). If it can be general purpose, make it so,
otherwise include the project name in the property name. It is possible to put
a version number in the property name if necessary, such as &#8220;MAP V2.
0&#8221;, but this should be done only if a major revision redefines the
existing label items. Label items can be added to an existing property without
changing a version number. And if you have a version number in the name, all
existing code that wants to find that property will have to be changed to
include the version number. 
<BR>
In
order to maintain a consistent set of names, a name registry (similar to the
one for BLTYPE) has been established for properties. Every property name must
be entered into this registry, with a pointer to documentation describing the
label items that can appear in the property. If you want to create a new
property, simply tell the keeper of the registry what name you want to use and
what the label items that make it up are (either explicitly or by referring to
a document). The registrar will check for duplicates, approve your request, and
enter your name into the registry. 
<BR>
At
the present time, the keeper of this registry is the VICAR system programmer. 
<BR>
The
name registry system is voluntary; the RTL makes no checks on the validity of
the names used. It is the responsibility of each individual programmer to make
sure that they use this system. Failure to do so may result in your program not
being accepted for delivery.
