Some devices, such as tapes, only allow sequential access on writes. The
program attempted to either back up and re-write a recordor write only part of
a record to a file on a sequential device.  User action: If the program
requires a file, use a disk or memory file. If the problem is not obvious
consult the cognizant programmer. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>NOSCHTSK

NO_SUCH_TASK
<BR>[VIC2-NOSCHTSK]
No such task in label
<BR>Explanation:
The requested task was not in the history label of the image file. This could
be either a program or user error. User action: Use &#8220;LABEL-LIST
'TASK&#8221; on the image file to determine the tasks contained in the label.
If a task name is being given on the command line, check the detailed help for
the program being used to verify that the correct syntax is being used. If the

NO_SUCH_UNIT
<BR>[VIC2-NOSCHUN]
No such unit; probable error in unit number
<BR>Explanation:
An action was requested on a nonexistent unit. This error generally indicates
that the program failed tocall 
<B>x/zvunit</B>
before using a unit number, or that the variable which contains the unit number
has been inadvertantly written over. User action: Verify that the unit number
being used is valid. If this is not the problem then consult the cognizant

NO_TASKS_IN_LABEL
<BR>[VIC2-NOT
ASK] No tasks in label;check file contents or create new label
<BR>Explanation:The
history label of the indicated file does not contain any history subsets,
denoted bythe TASK key word. This situation is usually caused by the user
deleting the history label. User action: Use the program LABEL or the DCL DUMP
facility to examine the label of the image file in question. If the label
contains any TASK key words, there is probably an executive bug, so consult the
system programmer. If not, and a history label is desired, use LABEL-REMOVE to
remove the system label, and LABEL-CREATE to create a new one.

BUF_NOT_MULT_OF_REC
<BR>[VIC2-NOTMULT]
Tape blocksize is not an integral number of records
<BR>Explanation:
For a tape which is being blocked, the block size for the tape (usually given
by BLOCKINGin the mount command) is not an integral number of records. This
case is not allowed because it makes reading the tape difficult and puts da ta
in a non-standard format. Asecond possibility is that the record size is
greater than 65,534 bytes. If this is thecase,  default the block size on the
mount, and  not use the NOBLOCK option in the 
<B>x/zvopen</B>
call, or you will get this error. User action: Verify that block size you gave
on the MOUNT command is a multiple number of records. The record size for a
band-sequential (BSQ) or band-interleaved by line (BIL) image is NS *(bytes per
pixel), and for a band interleaved by pixel (BIP) image is NB * (bytes per
pixel). If your record size is greater than 65,534 bytes, then do not specify
the blocksize on the MOUNT command, and do not use the NOBLOCK option from 
<B>x/zvopen</B>.
