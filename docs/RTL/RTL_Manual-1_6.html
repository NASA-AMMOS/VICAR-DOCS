1.6	Converting
Data Types &amp; Hosts 
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This
section describes how to convert data between different data types and hosts,
when the RTL does not do it for you. Most of the time, the RTL will take care
of any data type and host conversions automatically. There are times, however,
when you will need to do your own conversions. 
<BR>
The
translation routines have two parts: the setup routines, and the actual
translation routine. The setup routines must be called first, to create a
user-supplied buffer that describes the translation. The translation routine
may then be called as many times as necessary to do the actual translation. 
<BR>
It
is important to have as many translation buffers active at the same time as
needed. They can be created first, then used when needed in the program. This
is illustrated in the example below. 
<BR>
There
is only one setup routine internally, which requires the data type, integer
format, and real format for both the source and the destination. Since it is
unwieldy to specify all six parameters every time something needs translating,
there are five setup routines that provide part of the information for you.
They are all simply syntactic sugar for the internal setup routine. These five
are 
<B>x/zvtrans_set</B>,
<B>x/zvtrans_in</B>,
<B>x/zvtrans_inu</B>,
<B>x/zvtrans_inb</B>,
and 
<B>x/zvtrans_out</B>.
See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-Translat.html#_Ref394140865">Translation Routines</A>.<BR>
Where
do these six parameters come from? Either the source or the destination will be
in the native host representation, so only the foreign machine need be
specified. For 
<B>x/ztvtrans_set</B>,
both source and destination are the local machine. The information for the
foreign machine will usually come from the label of the file being read. This
is made easier by the 
<B>x/zvtrans_inu</B>
routine. For binary labels (which may be from a different host type than the
image),
<B>
x/zvtrans_inb
</B>
can be used to get the binary label host information.
<BR>
You
may make use of the 
<B>x/zvhost</B>
routine to get the INTFMT and REALFMT for a machine, given the type of machine.
This allows the user to specify that the file be written in a foreign format.
Although this is not the usual mode of operation for VICAR, it is allowed. An
example should help to clarify things. A file is being read which contains a
structure of mixed data type. The structure needs to be converted to native
format so it can be processed. The structure could come from the binary label
of the file, or it could be the data in an old-style IBIS file. It doesn't even
have to be a VICAR file  the translation routines don't care. The code below is
partially C code and partially pseudocode:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>/* Structure format:  An int followed by two reals and an array of 8 shorts */

struct {
   int type;
   float coord[2];
   short int values[8];
} data;
unsigned char *old_ptr;
static int short_conv[12], int_conv[12], real_conv[12]; /* Translation bufs */
static int short_size, int_size, real_size;    /* Pixel sizes for each type */

{    /* Begin here */

   char intfmt[20], realfmt[20];
   unsigned char input_buf[100];

   zveaction("sa", "");                        /* abort on error */

   /*** Determine INTFMT and REALFMT, possibly via zvhost. ***/
   /*** For a VICAR file, zvtrans_inu may be used instead. ***/
   /*** For binary labels, zvtrans_inb may be used.        ***/

/* Now set up the translation buffers. */

   zvtrans_in(short_conv, "HALF", "HALF", intfmt, realfmt);
   zvtrans_in(int_conv,   "FULL", "FULL", intfmt, realfmt);
   zvtrans_in(real_conv,  "REAL", "REAL", intfmt, realfmt);

/* Get pixel sizes in the input file for each type */

   zvpixsize(&amp;short_size, "HALF", intfmt, realfmt);
   zvpixsize(&amp;int_size,   "FULL", intfmt, realfmt);
   zvpixsize(&amp;real_size,  "REAL", intfmt, realfmt);

/* The following could be in a read loop if desired. */

   /*** Now the buffers are set up.  Read the data into input_buf. ***/

   old_ptr = input_buf;

   zvtrans(int_conv, old_ptr, &amp;data.type, 1);           /* One integer */
   old_ptr += int_size;
   zvtrans(real_conv, old_ptr, data.coord, 2);          /* Two reals */
   old_ptr += real_size*2;
   zvtrans(short_conv, old_ptr, data.values, 8);        /* 8 shorts */
   old_ptr += short_size*8;

}    /* That's all!  The data has been translated. */</PRE>
