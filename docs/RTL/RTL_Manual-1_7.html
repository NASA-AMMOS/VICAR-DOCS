1.7	Using
Binary Labels 
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
use of binary labels are not portable across computer architectures. Property
labels should be used instead. They serve the same function as binary headers,
though possibly not binary prefixes. Binary labels are allowed, but before
creating a new format, stop to consider if property labels might be a better
approach. See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-4_1.html#Heading70">4.1.2.1</A>
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-4_1.html#_Ref424721848">Using Property Labels</A>,
for details. 
<BR>
Binary
labels are application-defined extensions to a VICAR image used to store
information about the image. They have two parts: binary headers: extra records
at the beginning of the image, and binary prefixes: extra bytes at the
beginning of each image record. Binary labels are not part of image data. An
application will never see the binary label data unless it specifically asks
for it via a COND BINARY optional to 
<B>x/zvopen</B>.
<BR>
Binary
headers are extra records that appear at the beginning of the file, between the
standard label and the image. The number of records is specified by the NLB
(Number of Lines of Binary) system label item. Binary headers are often thought
of as extra &#8220;lines&#8221; of data, but depending on the file organization
they can actually be extra lines, samples, or bands. The size of each binary
header record is exactly the same as the size of each image record. The headers
specified by NLB occur exactly once in the file, not once per band (BSQ
organization) or once per line (BIL or BIP organization). 
<BR>
Binary
prefixes are extra bytes that appear at the beginning of each image record. The
number of bytes is specified by the NBB (Number of Bytes of Binary) system
label item. The image record consists of NBB bytes of binary prefix data,
followed by the samples that make up one line (for BSQ organization). Other
file organizations label the units differently: a record for BIL is NBB plus
the samples that make up one band, while a record for BIP is NBB plus the bands
that make up one sample. NBB is specified in terms of bytes, 
<I>not</I>
in terms of pixels, even if the pixels are larger than one byte. 
<BR>
Binary
labels (both headers and prefixes) pose a problem: the data stored in them is
application-defined. The RTL can&#8217;t  determine what types of data are
stored in a binary label, and therefore cannot automatically convert the data
to the native host format as it does for image data. The application program
has sole responsibility for converting binary data to the native host format
when it is read. 
<BR>
Few
application programs understand any given kind of binary label. For example,
the Voyager project has a definition for what goes in the binary label of its
images. The Voyager-specific processing programs know how to interpret these
labels and make use of them. The Galileo project also has a definition for its
binary labels. Galileo-specific programs can interpret the Galileo binary
labels. However, the two kinds of binary labels are different, and programs
written for one cannot make use of the other. The Magellan project has its own
binary labels in yet another format. 
<BR>
The
variety of binary labels poses a problem for a general-purpose application.
They could certainly be ignored, but then the information would be lost.
Therefore, many general-purpose programs copy the binary labels from the input
to the output, thereby preserving the information. As long as the information
is only copied, not used, the application need not know any details. 
<BR>
But
what happens when you mix machine types? A file with binary labels was written
on a VAX. You want to run COPY on the file from a Sun. COPY reads the input
image, and writes the output image. The RTL automatically converts the image
data from VAX to Sun format on input, and so the file gets written in Sun
format. The system labels also say it is in Sun format. COPY also reads the
binary labels, and writes them to the output file. The binary labels cannot be
converted, as neither the RTL nor the COPY program know what data types are in
the binary labels. Therefore, the binary labels get written out in the only way
possible: in VAX format. 
<BR>
The
problem is that the system labels say the file is in Sun format, but the binary
labels are still in VAX format.

1.7.1	Separate
Host Types 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
solution to the binary label problem is 
<I>separate</I>
host formats for the image and the binary label. The system labels HOST,
INTFMT, and REALFMT describe the host formats for the image host type, while
the system labels BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT describe the host formats for
the binary .
<BR>
It
is possible to generate files that have data in two different host formats: one
for the image itself and one for the binary labels. This is not particularly
desirable, but there is no practical alternative. As long as applications make
sure they use the binary label host formats while accessing the binary labels,
there&#8217;s no problem. However, this does place a burden on application
programmers to make sure they access binary labels correctly. 
<BR>
UPDATE
mode changes a file in place (rather than by copying) but does not convert it
to native format. The application must write out any binary label updates in
the format of the file, or it must read and re-write the entire binary label in
a native format. The RTL handles the conversion automatically for image data. 
<BR>
A
set of subroutines should be written for each type of binary label to
read/write/update that label. If all applications used this set of subroutines,
it wouldn't matter what format the binary labels were kept in. The subroutines
would be able to adapt and hide the details from the application program. If
changes were made to the binary labels, or even if they were converted to
property labels, the only code that would need to change would be the
subroutines that access them.

1.7.2	Programming
and Binary Labels 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This
Section shows how application programs make use of the binary label support
features provided by the RTL.
<BR>
The
use of binary labels is discouraged, due to portability problems. Where
possible, property labels should be used instead. They usually serve the same
function as binary headers, though possibly not binary prefixes. Binary labels
are allowed, but before creating a new format, stop to consider if property
labels might be a better approach. See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-4_1.html#_Ref424721848">4.1.2.1</A>
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-4_1.html#_Ref424721848">Using Property Labels</A>,
for details. 
<BR>
The
first problem is to open the file. Opening a file for input, update, and output
will be covered separately, as the behavior is slightly different. All modes
make use of 
<B>x/zvadd</B>
and 
<B>x/zvopen</B>
to open the files. The optional arguments mentioned may be used with either
routine. 
<BR>
For
an input file, binary label host formats are obtained from the BHOST, BINTFMT,
and BREALFMT system labels in the input file. The host formats thus obtained
are used for the 
<B>x/zvpixsizeb</B>
and 
<B>x/zvtrans_in</B>
routines, as well as for 
<B>x/zvget</B>.
The labels in the file are assumed to be correct, so there is no real override.
If you need an override, you can always use the host formats directly through 
<B>x/zvpixsize</B>
or 
<B>x/zvtrans_in</B>.
If the input file does not have the BHOST, etc. labels (for older images), then
VAX format is assumed. If the input file has no label at all (COND NOLABELS),
then the binary host formats are obtained from the BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT
optional arguments to 
<B>x/zvadd</B>
or 
<B>x/zvopen</B>.
<BR>
For
an update file, binary label host formats are also obtained from the file. The
only difference is if you wish to change the binary label type of the file. You
would need to re-write all the binary labels in the new format (be careful
because the size might change), but you would also need to change the binary
label format system label items (BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT) via 
<B>x/zladd</B>.
If you use 
<B>x/zladd</B>
to change these items, then do 
<I>not</I>
use 
<B>x/zvget</B>
on them, or use 
<B>x/zvpixsizeb</B>
or 
<B>x/zvtrans_in</B>
at all, as these routines may still use the original binary label format. The 
<B>x/zlget</B>
routine would get the new values. 
<BR>
The
BLTYPE optional argument is not used for input or update files. You may change
the BLTYPE system label on an update file via 
<B>x/zladd</B>,
however. See the next section for a description of BLTYPE. 
<BR>
Output
files are more complex. There are two basic cases: either you convert the
binary labels to native format, or you leave them alone. Which option you
choose is controlled by the BIN_CVT optional argument. 
<BR>
If
you set BIN_CVT to ON,  write the binary labels in the native host format. The
BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT system label items are set automatically to the
native host formats. There is no override; the corresponding optional arguments
are disabled when BIN_CVT is ON.
<BR>
Turn
BIN_CVT ON if you are writing a new file with binary labels in native format.
Although the name implies &#8220;convert&#8221;, it applies to any binary
labels written in native format. If BIN_CVT is ON, then the application must
know the kind of binary label being written. To do this, set the BLTYPE label
using the BLTYPE optional argument. See the next section for a description of
BLTYPE. 
<BR>
If
BIN_CVT is OFF (default), then the assumption is that you are copying the
binary label without converting it. The binary label host formats used are
those of the primary input file. If the primary input is not available, the
default is VAX format. The primary input may be changed with 
<B>x/zvselpi</B>.<BR>
BIN_CVT
OFF is the appropriate mode to use for general-purpose applications that do not
know the format of the binary label. The BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT optional
arguments to 
<B>x/zvadd</B>
and
<B>
x/zvopen
</B>
will override any other settings, so you could write binary labels in an
arbitrary format by setting to OFF and setting the three optional arguments to
appropriate values.
<BR>
If
you need to write specifically in VAX format, then do not depend on the default
being VAX format (as mentioned above). That may not be reliable, depending on
the primary input. If you want to write in a specific format, specify that
format in the optional arguments. Do not use 
<B>x/zladd</B>
to change the binary label system label items on an output file. Specify them
when you open the file. 
<BR>
The
BLTYPE optional argument is active if is OFF. Set it if you know the kind of
binary label being written. BLTYPE comes from the primary input if you do not
specify it. See the next section for a description of BLTYPE. 
<BR>
Once
a file is open, translate the binary label data you read and/or write to/from
native format. The actual translations are performed in the same way as
described in the rest of . Section 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-1_3.html#Heading5">Data Types and Host Representations</A>
(page 9), except using the BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT labels and the 
<B>x/zvpixsizeb</B>
and 
<B>x/zvtrans_inb</B>
routines.
<BR>
As
mentioned previously, 
<I>all</I>
binary label data read in must be converted to native format before being used.
There are no exceptions to this rule. 
<BR>
Binary
labels written out to a file may be in either native or foreign formats, as
discussed previously.

1.7.3	Binary
Label Types 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BLTYPE
improves the documentation of files and makes the VICAR system more robust.
Everyone using binary labels is encouraged to make use of BLTYPE. 
<BR>
BLTYPE
is a string that describes the kind of binary label in the file. It may be set
with 
<B>x/zvadd</B>
or 
<B>x/zvopen</B>,
or by calling 
<B>x/zladd</B>
on an already open file. No error checking or range of valid values are
enforced by the RTL.
<BR>
The
BLTYPE should be a short (maximum 32 characters) string that names the binary
label type. It does not attempt to describe the fields in the binary label at
all, but merely provides a pointer to how the fields could be determined. Some
of the currently registered names are &#8220;GLL_SSI_EDR&#8221;,
&#8220;IBIS&#8221;, and &#8220;M94_HRSC&#8221;. 
<BR>
To
maintain a consistent set of names, a name registry (similar to the one for
properties) has been established for BLTYPE. Possible values for BLTYPE must be
entered into this registry, with a pointer to documentation describing the
format of the binary label. To create a new kind of binary label, tell the
keeper of the registry what name you want to use and the format, either
explicitly or by stating that it is in document 
<I>X</I>.
The registrar will check for duplicates, approve your request and enter your
name into the registry.
<BR>
The
keeper of this registry is the VICAR system programmer. 
<BR>
The
RTL makes no checks on the validity of the names used. It is the responsibility
of each individual programmer to make sure that they use this system. Failure
to do so may result in your program not being accepted for delivery. 
<BR>
Application
programs that expect a certain kind of binary label should check the value of
BLTYPE to make sure that they have been given the correct type, and issue an
error message if it is incorrect. If BLTYPE is not present or blank, assume
that the binary label is of the correct type for backwards compatibility. 
<BR>
More
sophisticated application programs could use the BLTYPE field to read several
different kinds of binary labels. These could be different versions of the same
basic binary label (e. g. a type of &#8220;X V2. 0&#8221; for version 2 of the
X label type), or labels from different projects. Widespread use of BLTYPE will
allow a general-purpose program to be written that understands most binary
label types.
