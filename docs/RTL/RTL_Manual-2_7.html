2.7	Writing
Portable FORTRAN

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This
Section discusses writing portable FORTRAN code for VICAR applications and
describes how to deal with machine dependencies in VICAR code. It does not
explain the rules for writing portable FORTRAN; see a reference book on
FORTRAN. There are a few allowed VMS extensions to FORTRAN, which are described
below.

2.7.2	No
EQUIVALENCE for Type Conversion 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
use of EQUIVALENCE to convert among datatypes, especially byte to integer, is a
common trick. This practice is not portable. EQUIVALENCE must not be used to
convert any data types. EQUIVALENCE is used only to conserve memory. Access the
data using the same data type you stored it with.
<BR>
We
recommend the 
<B>x/zvtrans</B>
family of routines for data conversion. See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-1_6.html#Heading9">1.6</A>
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-1_6.html#Heading9">Converting Data Types &amp; Hosts</A>.
An alternative efficient method for converting between byte and integer uses
the functions 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">INT2BYTE</FONT></TT>
and 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">BYTE2INT</FONT></TT>.
Include the file &#8220;fortport&#8221; in your subroutine.
&#8220;fortport&#8221; is a SUBLIB include; add it to FTNINC_LIST in the
imakefile. 
<BR>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">INT2BYTE</FONT></TT>
and 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">BYTE2INT</FONT></TT>
assume that the data is in the 0 to 255 range. No bounds checking is performed.
The functions are implemented either as array lookups (rather than functions),
or as statement functions, so the include file must be present to get the
appropriate definition. Example:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>SUBROUTINE do_something(b, i)
        BYTE b
        INTEGER i
        INCLUDE 'fortport'
        b = INT2BYTE(i)

2.7.3	CHARACTER*n
for Strings 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
FORTRAN standard does not support the use of BYTE arrays as character strings.
They must be declared as CHARACTER*n variables. Moreover, descriptors are not
used on most machines, so there is no way to tell the difference between a BYTE
and a CHARACTER*n variable. Since CHARACTER*n variables have a declared length
associated with them, and BYTE arrays do not, any routine expecting a length
will get garbage if a BYTE variable is passed in. 
<BR>
The
RTL expects that 
<I>all</I>
strings will be CHARACTER*n variables. This applies to all RTL routines, but is
especially important for the output routines 
<B>qprint</B>
and 
<B>x/zvmessage</B>
(
<B>x/zvmessage</B>
is preferred over 
<B>qprint</B>
for new code). All strings destined for output must be CHARACTER*n variables. 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-2_7.html#Heading46">READ &amp; WRITE to Strings</A>
(page 38) discusses how to do output conversion to create the strings.
<BR>
While
changing output strings to CHARACTER*n is possible, there are many areas in the
code, in files and data structures, where strings are stored in BYTE arrays,
and it is not practical to change. For that reason, character strings in BYTE
arrays may be used if it is embedded too deeply to change. The SUBLIB routines 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">mvcl</FONT></TT>
and 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">mvlc</FONT></TT>
have been provided to convert between BYTE arrays and CHARACTER*n variables. Do 
<I>not</I>
copy data directly to a CHARACTER*n variable from a BYTE array, or vice-versa,
since that will fail if there are descriptors.
<BR>
Subroutines
should use CHARACTER*n string arguments. In cases where it is impractical to
change, BYTE arrays may be passed. Passing a CHARACTER*n argument where a BYTE
array is expected is just as bad as the opposite. If possible, include separate
entry points to the routine that accept both types. For example, the routine 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">vic1lab</FONT></TT>
returns data in a character string, while 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">vic1labx</FONT></TT>
returns data in a BYTE array.

2.7.4	READ
&amp; WRITE to Strings 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To
perform input and output conversion, use the FORTRAN I/O package on an
&#8220;internal file&#8221;. An internal file to FORTRAN is simply a
CHARACTER*n variable. Give the name of the variable (it may be a substring)
instead of the unit number in a FORTRAN READ or WRITE statement. Write to a
string and send the string to 
<B>qprint</B>
or 
<B>x/zvmessage</B>.
Do not attempt to write directly to the terminal. Any messages written directly
to the terminal will not appear in the session log and maybe printed in
unexpected ways due to interaction with VICAR I/O or SAGE.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="LEFT">Here
is one way to code the above example (the leading blank is not required in 
<B>xvmessage</B>):</P>

<PRE>REAL*8 VRES, VRAD, VTAN
      CHARACTER*80 MS1
      WRITE (MS1,1001) VRES, VRAD, VTAN
 1001 FORMAT ('VEL=', F9.2, ' (VRAD,VTAN)=(', F7.2, ',', F9.2, ') M/SEC')
      CALL XVMESSAGE(MS1, ')</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
There
are three things to note about this example:
</BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>The
DATA statement is separate from the declaration. Putting initialization data on
the declaration line is not portable.
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>The
format specifier may be put in-line in the WRITE statement if you wish.
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>The
numbers changed from the 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">outcon</FONT></TT>
call because the leading blank was eliminated. 
</UL><BLOCKQUOTE>
The
<B>xvmessage</B>
routine always prints the first character, with no carriage control. So, all
the character position numbers are one less than in the 
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">outcon</FONT></TT>
example. 
<BR>
Conversion
of data from string to numeric form using READ is similar. Use standard FORTRAN
I/O using the CHARACTER*n variable as the internal file. Substrings are much
more useful on READ to read only the portion you are interested in. For
example, the following call form is typical: 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>CALL INCON(NPAR, %REF(ALABEL(OFF+I+5:)),PAR,20)
      BUF(2) = PAR(1)                 !Frame number</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
where
ALABEL is the input string (already a CHARACTER*n variable), BUF(2) is an
integer receiving the value, and NPAR is ignored. The value is an integer in
the range 0 to 99 (obtained from the documentation), so this call could be
converted to:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>READ (ALABEL(OFF+I+5:),'BN,I2') BUF(2)</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
You
may want to make use of the ERR=n clause on reads in order to trap errors such
as a decimal point being present in an integer.

2.7.5	VMS
FORTRAN Extensions 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
VMS
has many non-standard extensions to its FORTRAN compiler, which are used
frequently in VICAR code. Some of these extensions are widely available in
other vendors' FORTRAN compilers, while others are not. Only standard FORTRAN77
code should be used in a portable program.
<BR>
To
find out what is standard and what isn't, refer to the ANSI FORTRAN standard,
or the 
<I>VAX
FORTRAN Language Reference Manual
</I>.
Anything printed in blue in that manual is non-standard FORTRAN and should not
be used, except as noted below. 
<BR>
Some
of the FORTRAN extensions are so useful that it would be impractical to write
VICAR code without them. Fortunately, these extensions are common industry-wide
and are available in the FORTRAN compilers for every machine MIPL is interested
in. Therefore some extensions to standard FORTRAN77 are allowed. These
extensions are listed below.
<BR>
You
should not use any non-standard statements or features that are not mentioned
below. If you absolutely have to, then make sure it is isolated in a
machine-specific section of code, and  provide a means for performing the same
function on machines that don't have that extension.

2.7.6	VMS-Specific
Code 
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many
current VICAR applications and subroutines have VMS-specific code embedded in
them. Some of it is obvious, like a system service call. Some is insidiously
difficult to find, like using a double precision floating point value as a
single. This works on VMS because the first half of a double value looks like a
float. This is not the case on any other machine. 
<BR>
All
VMS-specific code must be eliminated or isolated. If the same thing can be done
in a portable way, do it that way. If not, then isolate the VMS-specific code
and write UNIX code to perform the same function. If the function is useful as
a general-purpose subroutine, then put it in SUBLIB. If not, include it with
your code. See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-2_6.html#_Ref395921269">2.6.4.3</A>

for methods of dealing with machine-dependent code. 
<BR>
An
attempt is made below to list the types of VMS-specific code you will run into.
This is not and can not be an exhaustive list, as there are far too many
potential problem areas that will only be uncovered with more experience. Use
this list as examples of what to look out for. You should be familiar with
writing portable FORTRAN code; if not then see a standard FORTRAN manual (the
black type in the 
<I>VAX
FORTRAN Language Reference Manual
</I>
is a good source).
</BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>The
order of bytes in an integer (or any other data type) is reversed on VMS with
respect to most other machines. Any code that depends on byte order must be
changed to not do so. Byte-order dependencies typically come from converting
between BYTE and other data types, where the first byte of an integer is set to
the value of a byte, then used as an integer. This is typically accomplished
via EQUIVALENCE. Use the 
<B>x/zvtrans</B>
routines or the

<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>Integers
and double precision floating point values must not be used as INTEGER*2s or
REALs without conversion. On VMS, the address of a double could be treated as
the address of a real, or they could be equivalenced to each other. This worked
because the bit pattern for the first half of a double is the same as for a
real. The same is true for short vs. normal integers. A pointer to an INTEGER
could be treated as a pointer to an INTEGER*2 or even a BYTE. This is not valid
on non-VMS systems. The IEEE floating point standard uses different bit
patterns for doubles and for single-precision reals. For integers, most other
machines use the &#8220;big-endian&#8221; byte order. The first bytes of an
INTEGER are actually the higher-order bytes, unlike VMS, so the value cannot be
treated as an INTEGER*2.

practice is most common (and hardest to find) in subroutine calls, where a

System Calls must be eliminated or isolated. These include a whole range of
things, like system services (SYS$), VMS Run-Time Library calls (LIB$, etc.,
not to be confused with the VICAR RTL), RMS calls or structures, QIO calls for
I/O, AST's (asynchronous system traps), and anything else that is VMS specific.
Any subroutine or structure with a dollar sign ($) is suspect, as most VMS
system routines have $ in the name. 
</UL><P ALIGN="LEFT">There
are two choices for dealing with these. The first is to dispense with
system-specific calls and do things in a standard way, when possible. This
could be achieved by using standard UNIX-style calls that do the same thing
(many of which are implemented under VMS), which may imply calling C code that
calls the UNIX routines. The second is to isolate the VMS-specific code, and
write corresponding code that works on a UNIX system. Both versions could
either be included as separate modules in the program itself, or they could be
put in a SUBLIB subroutine if it's a capability that could be generally useful.
