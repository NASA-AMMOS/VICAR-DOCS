<PRE>call xvhost(host, intfmt, realfmt, status) 
status = zvhost(host, intfmt, realfmt);</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns
the integer and real data representations of a host given the host type name.
The returned values may be used with the translation routines or the INTFMT and
REALFMT system label items. This routine can also return the host type name,
for use with the HOST system label. 
<BR>
This
routine is rarely needed, as the normal case is to read any type of file (where
you get INTFMT and REALFMT from the file), and to write in native format (where
you don't need to specify the formats). However, this routine is useful in the
rare case that a program needs to write in a non-native format. The user can
select the machine type for output, and this routine will return the data
representations needed for that machine type.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Arguments:</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>HOST</B>:
string, input
<BR>HOST
is the type name of the host you want information about. It is not the name of
a particular machine, rather, it is the name of a type of machine. HOST
corresponds to the HOST system label. The HOST system label is intended for
documentation only, however, the same values are valid in this parameter.
Normally, the HOST parameter will come from user input. The valid values will
change as VICAR is ported to more machines, so the program should allow any
value as user input, then check the status from
<B>
x/zvhost
</B>
to see if the machine name is valid. The currently valid values are listed. See 
<A HREF="RTL_Manual-1_4.html#_Ref393618344">Table 1: Valid VICAR HOST Labels and Machine Types</A>.
In addition, the following values are accepted: 
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>NATIVE
: Returns the INTFMT and REALFMT for the machine currently running. 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>LOCAL

<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>HOSTNAME
: Special, see below. 
</UL></UL><P ALIGN="LEFT">The
value &#8220;HOSTNAME&#8221; is special. If this value is given for HOST, then
the return values change. The parameter INTFMT returns the host type name for
the machine currently running. The parameter REALFMT is undefined on output.
The value returned in INTFMT could then be used in another call to
<B>
x/zvhost
</B>
(which wouldn't gain much since &#8220;NATIVE&#8221; or &#8220;LOCAL&#8221; do
the same thing), or it could be used in a HOST label. This should be needed
only from FORTRAN. A C program should use the &#8220; NATIVE _HOST_LABEL&#8221;
macro defined in x/zvmaininc.h instead. Similarly, &#8220;NATIVE&#8221; and
&#8220;LOCAL&#8221; will be mainly useful in a FORTRAN program, as a C program
should use the NATIVE_INTFMT and NATIVE_REALFMT macros.

below. 
<I>Any</I>
other access to the internals of the buffer may cause your program to break in

merely moves the data from the source to the destination, without any
conversion. This can happen often when reading a file, where you don't know
ahead of time what host representation the input data is in. If it turns out to
be the native representation, no translation is necessary, and the first
integer of the buffer will be 0. This fact can sometimes be used to avoid
copying the data, making the program more efficient.

Create
translation buffer for output. The data will be converted from the machine's
native representation and data type of STYPE into a host representation of
(DIHOST, DRHOST) and data type of DTYPE. So, it converts from local to foreign
format. Since all processing must be done in native format on the machine the
program is running on, this translation is most often needed for output to a
file. 
<BR>
This
routine is less commonly used than the input routines. The general rule for
applications is to read any format, but write the native format. Translation on
output is not needed in this case. However, 
<B>x/zvtrans_out</B>
is provided for special cases where the data must be written in a different
host representation
