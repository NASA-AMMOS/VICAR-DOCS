12.	Apprendix
D: Unavailable Optional Arguments
</H1>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There
are a number of "unavailable" optional arguments. These are in the optional
argument table, but the validation routine returns a NOT_IMPLEMENTED error.
They are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>NLINES</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>Indicates
the number of lines to be accessed in a single operation. Defaults to 1.
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>SLICE1</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>Indicates
the starting pixel in the first dimension of the image. Thus this argument may
refer to the LINE, SAMP, or BAND dimension depending on the file organization.
It defaults to a starting value of 1and increments per read by 1. (NOT YET
AVAILABLE)
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>SLICE2</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>As
in SLICE1 but for the second file dimension. It defaults to 1 and remains at 1
unless explicitly changed. (NOT YET AVAILABLE) 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>SLICE3</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>As
in SLICE2 but for the third file dimension. (NOT YET AVAILABLE) 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>NSLICE1</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>Indicates
the number of pixels to be accessed in the first dimension of the file.
Defaults to the length of the first file dimension. (NOT YET AVAILABLE) 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>NSLICE2</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>As
in NSLICE1 except for the second file dimension. Defaults, however, to 1. (NOT
YET AVAILABLE) 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>NSLICE3</B>:
input, integer 
<BR>As
in NSLICE2 except for the third file dimension. (NOT YET AVAILABLE) 
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>U_N4</B>:
input, integer
<BR>Indicate
that the Executive is to ensure that the output file will have its fourth
dimension specified by this value This argument is useful for the program which
does not care about the file organization, and simply wants to deal with
records and pixels.
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT><B>N4</B>:
output, integer 
<BR>The
number of pixels in the fourth dimension of the image. The value returned
refers to the physical dimensions of the file and is independent of file
organization. 
</UL><P ALIGN="LEFT">See
the table in $V2TOP/rtl/source/global.c for details.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">There
are more of these arguments that were (are?) planned for but were never
implemented. The SLICE things should give you access to dimensions 1,2,3,(4)
regardless of the order (BSQ/BIL/BIP). Right now, you have to jump through some
hoops for order-independent reading. And there were apparently plans to have
4-dimensional files, but they were never realized. NLINES was for multi-line
reads (e.g. read a tile), which would be quite useful but has not been
implemented either.
