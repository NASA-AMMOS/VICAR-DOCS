<H2>Creating User Defined Text Fonts}
<H3>History}
The Hershey character fonts are the basis for the character
fonts provided by the XDT* subroutines.  The Hershey fonts were
originally obtained in a complicated bit saving format.  This format
was changed and expanded to an ASCII text file for ease of use and
modification.  The Hershey character fonts are widely used and
provide a large number of standard and special character fonts.
<H3>User Defined Fonts}
The XDT* subroutines are written so that users may define
their own text fonts.  Font files are named XXX.FON where XXX is a
three dight number between 000 and 999.  Font files are ASCII text
files and may be created using a text editor or a program.  XDFONT
is a symbol pointing to the directory containing the converted
Hershey font files.  Users may redirect this symbol to any directory
they wish.
<H3>Defining Characters}
Characters within a font are defined by a series of vectors
drawn on an image memory plane.  The time needed to draw a character
is directly related to the number of vectors making up the character.
Very simple to very complex fonts have been provided.  Special
characters and symbols have also been provided.  (See appendix E for
more information.)

Vectors making up a character have an origin in the lower
left hand corner of a box which defines the nominal size of a
character.  Vectors making up a character are
not required to stay within this box, however (e.g., lower case
letters with descenders).

The height of this box has been normalized to 1.0 (this is
usually the size of capital letters).  The width of the box is
font-dependent.  Users may define fonts with fixed or variable width
characters.  Users may also define fonts with white space included on
either side of a character or on top and bottom.  The Hershey
character fonts have variable-width characters and usually have white
space on either side of the character.  They do not have
white space on the top or bottom of capitol letters.

The width of the characters is used to determine the length
of character strings.  When a string is written, characters are drawn
with no space between them.  That is why white space is usually
included in the width of each character.

Characters may have an ASCII value of 0 to 127.  Characters
not defined in a font file have a width of zero (0).  A character
that has a width but no vectors defines a blank or space.
<H3>Font File Description}
The basic file format is a record containing the number of
characters described in the font file followed by descriptions of each
character.

A character description starts with a record containing the
ASCII code value for the character, the number of coordinate pairs,
and the nominal width of the character.  This record is
followed by zero or more coordinate pair records.  Each coordinate
pair record contains a move/draw flag and X,Y coordinates.  The
move/draw flag is a zero (0) for move and one (1) for draw.

Character descriptions do not need to be in numerical order
in the font file.  If the file contains duplicate descriptions (i.e.,
the same ASCII code value) the last one encountered will be used and
the others lost.
