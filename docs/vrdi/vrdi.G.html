<H2>Sample Application Programs}
<H3>Non-Interactive Sample Program}
This program sample does not interact with VIDS or other applications
and does not allow the operator to interact with the display device.
It is assumed the display device has been allocated prior to the 
execution of this program.  Error checking is not performed in this
sample because the error actions specified call for a program abort on
errors and fatal errors.

<H3>Simple Interactive Sample Program}
This sample program allows the operator to interact with the display
device through use of the VIDS XVINTRACT routine.  This simple sample
shows the minimum you can get away with when creating
an interactive application involving the VRDI.  It is not
a very good program, because when the configuration changes, it simply
changes it back.  Note that this program fragment is in pseudo-code and
is not intended to be typed and run.
\begin{tabbing}
xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=\kill
\>zddunit()\\
\>zddopen()\\
\>zddactivate()\\
\\
\>/*  sets mode, connects planes, etc.  */\\
\>initialize()\\
\>loop\\
\>\>xvintract()\\
\>\>/*  config changed?  */\\
\>\>if (zdfconfig())\\
\>\>\>initialize()\\
\>\>process\_command()\\
\>end-loop\\
\>zddclose()\\
\end{tabbing}
If it is critical that you know exactly what is displayed, then the
following could be added to the above after the ZDFCONFIG check:
\begin{tabbing}
xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=xx\=\kill
\>if (zdfimage(..., 0))\\
\>\>for each plane used\\
\>\>\>if (zdfimage(..., plane)\\
\>\>\>\>refresh\_imp(plane)\\
\>\>end-for\\
\end{tabbing}

<H3>Better Interactive Sample Program</H3>
This sample is more sophisticated than the previous example, because
it looks at exactly what has changed in the configuration, and adapts
to it.  As an example, this application can only run in color mode,
so it makes sure that it is in color mode, but it adapts to everything
else.  This is much better from the user's point of view, because the
user is more in control of the session.

An application that only used monochrome mode would be quite similar,
except there would be only one image plane to deal with, making some of
the loops unnecessary.

This sample also shows some examples of how certain things would be
handled--like reading the stretch or the cursor position.  Note that,
in general, the numbers 1, 2, or 3 are passed for the red, green, and
blue planes.  These numbers are actually look-up table numbers, and
have to be translated to actual image plane numbers by ZDSIMP.  You
could instead pass around the actual image plane numbers, of course,
as long as you know which look-up table they are connected to.  You
could call ZDSIMP for each plane each time the configuration changes,
then use the saved value.

\>\>\>zdclocation(..., raw\_x, raw\_y)\\
\end{tabbing}
NOTE:  You may use the raw coordinates for some things.  If you need
the image plane coordinates, you must translate.  The image plane
location may be different for each plane.  You could always assume one
plane, like red, if you want (VIDS tends to use the graphics
plane).  You could use ZDCILOCATION, but if you're doing more
than one plane, it is best to use ZDCLOCATION and the
coordinate translation routines so the user doesn't move the
cursor in between ZDCILOCATION calls.  Also, note the use
of ZDSIMP to get the plane number currently in use for each
color.
