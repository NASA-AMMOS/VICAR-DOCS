<H2>VRDI Application Program Guidelines}
\label{guidelines}
As systems become more interactive and more user-friendly, they also
typically become more complex to program.  With an interactive display
program such as VIDS running, the user is in control and can do anything
to the display device at any time.  This has the potential for interfering
with an application program unless careful attention is paid.  For
this reason, application programs that use the VRDI should follow a few
simple rules in order to coexist peacefully with VIDS and other display
programs.  Several routines have been added to the VRDI to make these
rules as simple and painless as possible.
<H3>Never Assume Anything}
The most basic rule is:  ``Never Assume Anything''.  You cannot assume that
because you set a zoom factor, the zoom will be the same the next time
you need to use it.  The solution to this is simple:  always call the
VRDI to read the state of the display rather than relying on a saved
local variable.  There are VRDI routines that return
information, like XDDINFO or XDLREAD.  In addition, there is a whole
class of VRDI routines, the XDS* (status) routines, which return
information.  These routines return the value as the function return
instead of a parameter.  Thus, you can do a direct substitution of the
function call any time you would normally use a local variable.

There are times when it is appropriate to save information locally.
For example, the size of the image planes will not change often.  Furthermore,
when the size does change, the XDFCONFIG flag will be set, so you can check it.
For items like these, where there is a flag available to indicate changes,
you may save the items locally and only update them when
the flag is set.  Additionally, items that are used many times in
succession, e.g., in an extended calculation or in a loop, may be saved
locally.
<H3>Check the Flags}
There are several flags that indicate when something has changed.  These
should be checked after every XVINTRACT call to determine if the device
configuration has changed.  They may also be checked after every direct
call to VIDS by the application.  However, since the application issued
the call to VIDS, it should know the effect of the call, and checking
the flags may not be necessary.  The flags are cleared automatically
every time they are checked.

The most important flag is XDFCONFIG, which indicates that the display
device configuration has been modified, e.g., changing the size of the
image planes, changing what planes are displayed, or changing the display
mode (monochrome/pseudo-color/full color).  If this flag is set, you have
two choices:  1) reset the configuration, or 2) determine what changed
and use the new configuration.  For example, if the user changes the
monochrome image memory plane from 1 to 2, the application may reset it
to plane 1 or use plane 2.

The XDFLUT flag is not important for most applications.  It is used
primarily by VIDS.  Most applications, if they need to know the look-up
tables at all, will need it only infrequently.  Thus, they can read the
tables from the hardware every time, using XDLREAD, and not use this flag.

The XDFGLUT flag is similar in use to the XDFLUT flag.  However, if
it is critical that your graphics be displayed in some non-standard
graphics look-up table, you can monitor the XDFGLUT flag and reset the
grpahics look-up table if it changes.

The XDFIMAGE flag will be important for some applications and not for
others.  If you need to check, you should first check with a plane number
of 0, which lets you know if any planes have changed.  If they have, you
can check each plane to determine which has changed.  For each changed
image plane, the application may either refresh the screen, thereby
redrawing the image, or could just note the fact that a change has
occurred, and continue.

Note that the change may be what the user wants, i.e., the
user displayed a part of another image in a small area on the screen for
reference.  For this reason, you should not indiscriminately refresh the
image.  Many applications will not need to check this flag, as they can
assume the user knows what he is doing.
<H3>Allow User Flexibility}
This is not a rule, but rather a suggestion.  Allow the user as much
flexibility as you can.  You should have as few restrictions as possible.

The user should be in charge of his interactive session.  If something
has changed, there was probably a reason for the change.  You
should respect the user's choice, if at all possible, and not arbitrarily
change it back.  Sometimes this is not possible, e.g., you can only
handle color images and the user changed to monochrome.  But, in
general, you should honor the choices the user makes, even if it makes
your task a little more difficult.

For example, if your application works in monochrome mode, and the
user sets pseudo-color mode, you should allow this.  If the user changes
the current monochrome plane, you can either use the new plane, or
change it back.

As another example, do not change the cursor that the user has selected.
Use the XDCSHOW and XDCOFF routines to turn the cursor on and off
without changing the user's form and blink rate selection.  In other
words, you should never call XDCON (which changes the form and blink
rate of the cursor as well as turning it on) unless the user specifically
requests that the cursor be changed.

Similarly, if the user sets the device to a different resolution, you
should use the new resolution if at all possible.  The user
changed resolutions for a reason, and you should not ignore it.

You should always provide some kind of refresh command, which redraws the
application's image and associated graphics.  This allows the user to
quickly display something else and then return to what the application
was doing with a simple refresh command.
<H3>Graphics Plane}
Do not change the default graphics look-up table unless you must.  The
default table (set by XDGLINIT) contains most of the colors you
will need in the graphics plane.  Plus, by using the default table,
your graphics will retain their color after your application exits, and
other graphics that the user has selected will still display correctly.

As a corollary to this, you should never use XDGLCONSTANT.  It sets up
a look-up table in which everything is the same color.  You should also
avoid using XDGLWRITE to write your own table, since
it will interfere with other applications that use the default graphics
look-up table.  If you do need to change the graphics look-up table,
it would be courteous to reset it before your program exits.

Just because you use the default table does not mean you can assume you
know what the default table is.  It will be different on different devices
due to hardware differences.  The particular DN value you use for red may
not be the DN value for red on another device.  There are two
routines to assist you in finding the right DN value to use.  They are
XDGCOLOR, which accepts a string of color names and returns the DN
value that best matches, and XDRGB, which accepts an RGB triple and
returns the DN value that best matches.  One note of caution:  on a
small, limited look-up table the best match to your color value may
not be a very good match.  If you require a specific color, you may
need to use XDGLWRITE to obtain it.
<H3>Coordinates}
\label{coordinates}
There are two different coordinate systems used by the VRDI.  They are
raw, or screen, coordinates, and image plane coordinates.  You need to
be careful to make the distinction correctly.

Screen coordinates are always the size of the video display.  The upper
left corner of the monitor is always location (1,1).  The screen
coordinates are never zoomed, either, so the bottom right corner is
always the size of the video (e.g., (512,512) or (1024,1024), etc.).
Screen coordinates are used primarily for the cursor, as the cursor
can not move off-screen.  The only routines that use screen coordinates
are XDCLOCATION, XDCSET, XDCIMP2RAW, and XDCRAW2IMP.  Everything
else uses image plane coordinates.  If you are reading the cursor location
to find a pixel in a particular image, you should use image plane
coordinates, either with XDCILOCATION or with the coordinate translation
routine XDCRAW2IMP.

Image plane coordinates are always the size of the image planes.  The
upper left corner of the image plane is always location (1,1).  However,
that location may or may not be the upper left of the screen.  If a
hardware pan is in effect, the upper left corner of the screen will not
be (1,1) in image plane coordinates.  Likewise, the number of pixels on
the screen will change with different zooms.  For example, if the video
size is $512 \times 512$, at zoom 1 there will be $512 \times 512$
image plane pixels
displayed.  At zoom 2, however, there will only be $256 \times 256$ pixels.
So, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between image plane and screen
coordinates.  Also, the coordinates for different image planes may not
line up on the screen, due to differing pans and zooms on each image
memory plane.  The VRDI routines, XDCRAW2IMP and XDCIMP2RAW, were
created to translate between raw (screen) and image memory plane
coordinates specifically to deal with the difficulties described above.

It should be noted that the screen and image memory plane coordinate
systems are exactly the ones used by VIDS.  VIDS has one extra system,
file coordinates, but the other two are identical.
