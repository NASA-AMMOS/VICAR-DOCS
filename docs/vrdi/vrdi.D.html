<H2>Hardware Selection Criteria}
The following is a list of display hardware characteristics.
All of the listed items may or may not be important to your
application.  However, all are required to fully implement the MIPL
machine-independent interface.

When selecting a display device, a definition of the minimum
hardware required to do the job is necessary.  Some hardware
characteristics may be simulated in software to save cost.
<H3>Control Registers}
All device control registers should be readable and writeable
by software, i.e. cursor control and location, display window,
aspect ratio, etc.  This is necessary if several programs are to
access an image sequentially.  Many devices have write-only
registers.
<H3>LUT/DACs}
There is a LUT (Look-Up Table) for each DAC (Digital to
Analog Converter).  The LUT is used to modify the pixel values from
an image memory plane before they are output by the DAC.

All LUT tables are readable and writeable by software.  This
is necessary if several programs are to access an image
sequentially.  Many devices have write-only LUT tables.

Each image memory plane may be connected to any or all
LUT/DACs (video outputs).  This is necessary if the device is
configurable under software control.

LUTs may be bypassed under software control.  In this mode
pixel values are sent directly to the DACs.  In some systems, the LUTs
may not be bypassed.

Each LUT/DAC has a zoom factor associated with it.

LUT/DACs contain one or more pixel transformation tables (LUT
sections).  Each section consists of 256 entries, one for each pixel
value.  LUTs and DACs should have a minimum of 8 bits of output.  More
bits are needed if accurate gamma correction is desired.
<H3>Graphics Overlay}
Each device should have graphics overlay capability.

Graphics overlay works by pixel substitution.  Any non-zero
graphics overlay pixel is substituted for regular pixels before going
to the DACs.  In this way, graphics overlay data is written on top of the
output image.

The graphics overlay LUT is different from the other LUTs in
that it has three tables (red,green,blue) in full color displays.

Any image memory plane may be used as a graphics overlay
plane by connecting it to the graphics overlay LUT.  This is
necessary if the device is configurable under software control.  Some
devices have fixed or no graphics overlay plane.  In many devices the
graphics overlay plane has fewer bits than the image memory planes.

The video output should support 30hz interlaced and 60hz
non-interlaced in low resoluton ($512 \times 512$).  It should also support
60hz interlaced in high resolution ($1024 \times 1024$).  $1 \times 1$
and $4 \times 3$ aspect ratios should be supported for low and
high resolution.
<H3>Image Memory Planes}
Image memory planes are eight (8) bits deep.

Each plane has a display window and an access window associated
with it.

Physical image memory planes are configurable into several
logical image memory plane sizes--i.e. $512 \times 512$,
$1024 \times 1024$, etc.

Read and write with mask into any image memory plane should
be available.  Only non-zero bits in the mask may be read or written
in the image memory plane.
<H3>Cursor}
One or more cursors should be available.  Each cursor should
have several forms and blink rates.  The cursor can be displayed in
several colors.  The cursors work by pixel substitution similar to
the graphics overlay.

Cursors should have one or more shapes.  However, user-defined
cursor patterns are preferred.

The center of the cursor pattern should be locatable over every
pixel in an image memory plane.  Many display devices use the upper
left corner as the (0,0) location of the cursor pattern and restrict
the cursor to the display window.  Useful cursor shapes such as X or
cross cannot be moved over all of the image memory plane pixels in
this case.
<H3>Alphanumeric Font Generator}
Alphanumeric font generators are not very useful.  They make
an expensive display device act as a $24 \times 80$ terminal.  
However, font generators are supported by the VRDI routines.
<H3>Interactive IO Devices}
One or more interactive IO devices should be available.  A
tablet, mouse or puck is preferred.  The IO devices should be a byte
stream data device using an RS232 interface.  This allows the device
to be located a distance from the display device itself.
<H3>Special Hardware}
Hardware should be available to perform logical and
arithmetic operations between image memory planes.  Hardware
should also be available to fill areas, draw
vectors, compute histograms, etc.  This may be simulated in software
to reduce hardware costs.

Logical and arithmetic operations between two
planes should be able to deposit the results in a third plane.

Hardware should be available to have the display window or
cursor automatically track an interactive IO device.  No CPU cycles
should be used for this task.
<H3>Other Considerations}
Application programs should be able to read or write single
pixels into any image memory plane at any location.  Application
programs should be able to read or write a line of pixels of any
length into any location in an image memory plane.  

The graphics overlay and the cursor should use different LUTs
if both are to be used at the same time.  Without this,
the cursor will disappear into the overlay as it is moved.  Many
display devices use the same LUT for both.

Simplicity of control registers can make the writing of
programs easier.  Some devices perform many functions with a single
control register.  For example, the cursor
location and blink rate may use the same register.  When you want to
change one, you must change both.  Many applications are written in
high level languages, such as FORTRAN, that do not have bit
manipulation facilities.  Devices that have multi-purpose registers usually
do not put values on easily used bit boundaries.  For example, they
might use bits 2-9 for one thing and 11-17 for another.

The location of control registers can also be a problem.  If
the cursor control uses two registers, they should be next to each
other.  This would require one write instead of two.  

Many devices allow the display window to move only in pre-defined
increments (e.g., 4 pixels at a time).  This may cause problems,
depending on your application.  This can be important if the cursor
location is relative to this window and not the image memory plane.

Interface software provided by the vendor can make
programming easier if it is full and complete.  Unfortunately, some
vendors only supply software that requires a deep knowledge of the
machine.  For example, there should be a raster line write routine,
not a need to load three registers with values to write the line.
