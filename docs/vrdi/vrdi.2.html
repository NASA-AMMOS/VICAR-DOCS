<H2>VRDI Overview}
<H3>Allocation of Display Hardware}
MIPL is expected to have a variety of image processing hardware.
Resources are allocated and
deallocated by functions of the VRDI.  The variety of MIPL image
processing hardware allows for flexibility in meeting the MIPL users
needs.  The user will be able to query the system about
available resources and the current configuration of hardware
allocated to the user.

Allocation commands may be issued at any time after a MIPL user has
logged onto the system.  Only physical display devices may be
allocated.  A user gets all the resources associated with a display device.
<H3>Workstations}
A workstation is a physical location where a MIPL user
works.  At that location is a table, chair, terminal,
monitor and interactive IO devices.  A MIPL user may allocate
a display device in a standard configuration by allocating that 
particular workstation.  
Interactive IO devices are associated with particular
display devices.
The user accesses the device by a unique unit number determined at
allocation time.
<H3>Display Devices}
A standard display device may be allocated by a MIPL user.
When a standard display device is allocated, the allocated
hardware is configured into one of the standard configurations (full
color, pseudo-color or monochrome).  The standard configuration
includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A number of image memory planes are assigned to the display device.
\item The access window of all image memory planes is set to the complete
image memory plane.
\item The display window of all image memory planes is moved to
the upper left hand corner of each image memory plane, coordinates (1,1).
\item All cursors are set to type 1, autotracking, and turned off.
\item The alphanumeric font generator is cleared and turned off.
\item For full color devices, image memory planes are connected 1 to LUT 1
(red), 2 to LUT 2 (green) and 3 to LUT 3 (blue).  Image memory plane
4 is connected to the graphics overlay plane LUT.  All LUTs are set
to no bypass and LUT section 1.
\item For pseudo-color devices, image memory plane 1 is connected to LUT 1
(red), LUT 2 (green) and LUT 3 (blue).  Image memory plane 2 is
connected to the graphics overlay LUT.  All LUTs are set to no bypass
and LUT section 1.
\item For monochrome devices, image memory plane 1 is connected to LUT 1.
Image memory plane 2 is
connected to the graphics overlay plane LUT.  All LUTs are set to
nobypass and LUT section 1.
\item Display of the graphics overlay plane is turned off.
\end{itemize}
<H3>Coordinate System}
There are two different coordinate systems used by the VRDI.  The
first is raw, or screen, coordinates; the second is image memory
plane coordinates.  In both cases, the coordinate system is the
standard line/sample convention currently used for IPL images.  The
upper left corner of the display device is coordinates (1,1) in
raw coordinates, just as the upper left corner of the image memory
plane is coordinates (1,1) in image memory plane coordinates.
Coordinates increase downward and to the right.  Coordinates are
integer values corresponding to individual pixels on the screen or
in the image memory plane.  We provide further discussion of the
two coordinate systems and translation between the two in
section~\ref{coordinates}.
<H3>Image Memory Planes}
An image memory plane (IMP) in a display device is a two-dimensional
array of 8-bit pixels.  This limits the number of different pixel
values that may be displayed to 256 (0 to 255).  Image memory planes
are logical entities having a given size and are numbered starting
with one (1).  The display software maintains the connection between
logical and physical image memory planes.  A user may query the
system to obtain information about the number and size of the image
memory planes allocated to a display device.  Some display devices
allow the image memory planes to be configured into several sizes.
Whatever the configuration, all image memory planes in the display
device are the same size.
<H3>Look-Up Tables}
Image memory planes can be connected to Look-Up Tables (LUTs) which
in turn are connected to Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) that
output video signals to monitors.  By convention, LUT 1 is assumed to
output the RED signal for full color and pseudo-color images.  LUT 2
outputs GREEN and LUT 3 outputs BLUE.

LUTs may be bypassed (pixel values sent directly to the DAC) or the
pixel value may be passed through the LUT for conversion to another value
before being sent to the DAC.  LUTs may also have more than one
section or conversion table.  Although each section or table in a LUT
has 256 entry points (one for each possible pixel value) it may have
more than an 8-bit output value.  This difference is sometimes used
to load the LUT with a more accurate gamma correction curve than 8
bits will provide.  The user may query the system to obtain
information about the number of sections in each LUT and the size of
the output value.  Sections are numbered starting with one (1).
<H3>Graphics Overlay Plane}
The displaying of graphics overlay data is logically the same as
displaying data in any image memory plane.  Any image memory plane
may be used as a graphics overlay plane by connecting it to the
graphics overlay LUT.  The graphics overlay LUT consists of three
tables (red, green and blue) that look and act exactly like the
regular LUT tables.  The overlay process is accomplished by replacing
output pixels with overlay pixels.  This takes place only if the
graphics pixel has a non-zero value.  The display of graphics overlay
data may be turned on or off under software control.
<H3>Cursors}
A cursor in a display device is a group of pixels which overlay
the data on the image memory planes.  Cursors work by pixel
substitution and are written on top of the graphics overlay
data.  Each cursor has a number of forms and blink rates, which
are device-dependent.  The center of the cursor pattern may be
moved over any pixel in any image memory plane.  The location
of the cursor may be set or read (in either screen coordinates
or image memory plane coordinates) by the VRDI cursor routines.
In addition, the size and color of the cursor may be
changed (for some devices) by the VRDI cursor routines.
<H3>Subroutine Naming Convention}
Each of the display interface routines contains both a C interface
and a FORTRAN interface.  The first two letters in the name of each
C routine are ``ZD''.  The first two letters in the name of each
FORTRAN routine are ``XD''.  The remaining letters are the same for
each of the interfaces.  The third letter in the name of each routine
indicates the major function or hardware component with which the
routine is  concerned.  The letters correspond to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A  -  Alphanumeric Font Generator
\item C  -  Cursor Generator
\item D  -  Device Configuration
\item E  -  Error Handling
\item F  -  Interprocess Communication Flags
\item G  -  Graphics Overlay Plane
\item I  -  Image Memory Planes
\item L  -  Look-Up Tables
\item S  -  Device Status
\item T  -  Text Generation in Image Memory Planes
\item X  -  Interactive IO Devices (tablets, joysticks, etc.)
\end{itemize}
The rest of the routine name describes the function of the routine.

For example, the routine name ZDLREAD is translated as follows:
\begin{tabbing}
xxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxx\=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\=\kill
\>ZD\>Interface\>C Interface\\
\>L\>Category\>Look-Up Table Routine\\
\>READ\>Purpose\>Read Look-Up Table\\
\end{tabbing}
<H3>Subroutine Parameters}
Section~\ref{routines} of this document describe the parameters to
each of the VRDI subroutines.  These descriptions include whether the
parameter is an input or output, its data type, its dimension, and a
comment on its purpose.  Since the data types for FORTRAN and C are
not necessarily alike, the descriptions include both types of data.
The FORTRAN subroutine parameters are all passed by reference.  The
C subroutine parameters are generally passed by value, except when
the parameter is a string or is an output from the subroutine.  The
description of each subroutine indicates whether the C parameters
are passed by value or by reference.
\subsubsection{C Interface}
A parameter data type may fall into one of five categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item integer:  The C default for integer (int).
\item real:  The C default for real (float).
\item byte:  An 8-bit value (unsigned char).
\item logical:  A parameter that is either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).
The C default for integer (int).
\item string:	A null-terminated array of 8-bit characters (char),
which may be passed as an array or as a pointer to the first element
in the array.  Another parameter, usually named LENGTH, will accompany
a parameter of type string.  This parameter will specify the number of
characters in the string.  If the length parameter is zero (0), the
string should be null-terminated to indicate the length of the string.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{FORTRAN Interface}
A parameter data type may fall into one of five categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item integer:	The FORTRAN default for INTEGER (INTEGER*4).
\item real:	The FORTRAN default for REAL (REAL*4).
\item byte:	A single 8-bit value.  In FORTRAN it may be a BYTE,
CHARACTER or LOGICAL*1.
\item logical:	A parameter that is either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).
In FORTRAN this may be a LOGICAL or an INTEGER.
\item string:	A string is an array of 8-bit characters and
may be passed either by descriptor (CHARACTER*n), or by
reference (BYTE, LOGICAL*1, or INTEGER array).

Another parameter, usually named LENGTH, will accompany a parameter
of type string.  This parameter will specify the number of characters
in the string.  If the length parameter is zero (0), the string should
be null terminated or the string should be passed by descriptor.

If the string is passed by descriptor and the length parameter is
not zero, the number of characters in the string will be the
smaller of the two values (the length field in the descriptor or
the length parameter).  If the length parameter is smaller, the
string will be padded with blanks up to the length of the descriptor.
If the length parameter is larger, the string will be truncated to
fit into the descriptor.
\end{itemize}
<H3>Subroutine Returned Status Codes}
Each of the display interface routines are functions.  They may be
used as subroutines by just calling them or as functions by using
them in expressions.  When used as functions, the returned status 
is an integer value.  In most cases, the returned value is a code
signifying the success or failure of the operation.

The value returned by the routines determines the error that
occurred.  Each possible error that can occur has its own unique
value.  Most routines that complete successfully return a value of
SUCCESS (1).  Exceptions are the flag routines, XDF* (which return TRUE
or FALSE), and the status routines, XDS* (which return the requested
information).  See appendix A for a list of possible errors, their
values, and descriptions.

Each error status falls into one of three categories:  WARNING,
ERROR, or FATAL.  WARNINGs can be considered programmer/user
information and should have little or no effect on the execution of
the program.  ERRORs are really recoverable errors, i.e., things
that go wrong but can later be ``fixed''.  FATALs are non-recoverable
errors.  If one of these occurs the program should terminate
immediately.

Along with these returned error statuses are utilities routines to
help the programmer handle the errors:  XDEACTION,
XDESIGNAL, and XDELEVEL.  XDEACTION allows the programmer to set
the action to perform for each category of error codes.  The actions
that can be performed are:  1) return the status code, 2) issue a
system error message and return the status code, or 3) issue a system
error message and abort.  XDESIGNAL can be used to provide the system
error message for a given status code.  XDELEVEL can be used to
determine the error severity level for a given status code--i.e.,
FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, or NO ERROR.

The system error message returned by the VRDI includes a text code
abbreviation corresponding to the particular error.  If the VRDI is
being run interactively, you can obtain help on the error by typing
"help-message vrdi-xxxxxxxxx", where "xxxxxxxxx" is the text code
of the error in question.  This help is also available within VICAR.

In most cases, an application program need only check the returned
function value for SUCCESS (or lack thereof).  If you need to check
for a particular error, the error codes and values are listed in
appendix A.  Additionally, if you use the C interface, you may
insert the following statements at the beginning of your program:

\#include XDMAININC\\
\#include xderrors\\

and access the error codes by name.

The constant name of each error code that can be returned by a
particular function is listed under the function description in
Section~\ref{routines}.
<H3>Text Generation}
In most cases the display devices do not have alphanumeric font
generators.  Instead, a series of routines
are supplied that will allow the user to write text directly into the
image memory planes as pixel values.  In order to not modify the image,
the text may be written into the overlay plane and displayed.

The Hershey character fonts are supplied to give the user several
fonts to choose.  Users may also design their own fonts.  See
appendix F for further details.
<H3>Access Window}
Each image memory plane has an access window associated with it.  The
access window defines the area of an image memory plane where the
pixels may be modified.  Pixels outside the access window cannot be
modified by the user.  The size and location of the access window into
the image memory plane is application-defined.  The default access window
is the entire image memory plane.
<H3>Display Window}
Each image memory plane has a display window associated with it.  The
display window defines the location, in image plane coordinates, of the
upper left corner of the video screen--i.e., the display window
defines the offset of the image memory plane onto the screen.  For example,
if the display window is set to be (100,100), then image memory plane
pixel (100,100) will appear at screen location (1,1).  Every other
image memory plane pixel will be offset in a similar manner.  The display
window for each image memory plane is application-defined.  The default
display window is (1,1).  Only the upper left corner of the display
window is defined because the size of the window displayed on the monitor
is determined by the hardware.
<H3>Virtual Display Device}
The software described in this document defines and describes display devices
(frame buffers).  Many of the existing display devices do not have all
of these capabilities.  In these cases the software simulates the
desired functions to the best of its ability.  With some display
devices it is not possible to simulate a function; in this case
an appropriate error code is returned.

The following is a description of the virtual display device defined
by the software:
\begin{itemize}
\item A number of square eight (8) bit image memory planes.  The currently
allowed sizes are $512 \times 512$, $1024 \times 1024$ or
$2048 \times 2048$.  Image
memory planes of larger sizes may be configured into smaller ones.
Each image memory plane has an access window and a display window 
associated with it.  Any image memory plane can be connected to any or
all LUT/DACs including the graphics overlay LUT.
\item Each display device has 1 or more (3 for full color) LUT/DACs.  Each
LUT contains one or more pixel transformation tables (sections).
Each table has 256 entries, one for every possible pixel value.  LUTs
may be bypassed under software control, allowing pixel values to be
sent directly to the DACs.  The LUT section is also under software control.
\item The graphics overlay LUT is different from the standard LUTs in that
it has three tables (red, green, blue) in full color display
devices.  Graphics overlay works by pixel substitution.  If graphics
overlay is ``ON'', non-zero overlay pixels are substituted for regular
pixels before going to the the DACs.  In this way graphics overlay data
is written on top of the output image.  Any of the image memory
planes may be connected to the graphics overlay LUT.
\item The alphanumeric font generator works the same way as the graphics
overlay does (pixel substitution).  Font information is written on
top of graphics overlay data.  No MIPL display device has a font generator.
\item One or more cursors are available.  Cursors also work by pixel
substitution and are written on top of the graphics overlay data.
Each cursor has a number of forms and blink rates.  The cursor form
also includes the color of the cursor.  The center of the cursor
pattern may be moved over every pixel in any image memory plane.  The
location of the cursor may be read or written by software.
\item The display device has hardware which allows arithmetic and logical
operations between image memory planes, area fill, histogram
generation, and vector drawing.
\item All LUT tables are readable and writeable by software.
\item All device control registers are  readable  and  writeable  by
software. 
\item Aspect ratios of 1x1 and 4x3 are available.
\item The location of the display window may be read and written by
software.  The display window may be moved under software control so
that every pixel in an image memory plane can be seen.
\item Interactive IO devices may be connected to the display device.  The
cursor or the display window may be set to automatically track one of
the interactive IO devices.
