<blockquote>This Section lists all the valid vimake macros. Although the order
doesn't matter to vimake (since they are all preprocessor defines), you should
keep entries in the order presented here for consistency. </blockquote><p>There
are nine broad classes of macros, which are listed in separate sections below. 
<a name="Heading25"></a><a name="_Toc429910612"></a></p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading5">2.2.1 Module Type Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define the type of the module. One and only one of these macros must
appear. Note: Do not use a tab between the macro and the name on any of these;
use only spaces. <tt>make</tt> can be quite sensitive about tab characters in
the module type names. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>PROGRAM</b> <i>x</i>- This imakefile produces an executable program.
"<i>x"</i> specifies the name of the program. By convention, the name of the
COM file minus ".com".<br><br>
<li>	<b>SUBROUTINE</b> <i>x</i>- This imakefile produces a subroutine or
subroutine package. The value<i> x</i> specifies the name of the subroutine, or
of the collection of subroutines. By convention, the name of the COM file minus
".com".<br><br>
<li>	<b>PROCEDURE</b> <i>x</i> - Specifies that this imakefile is for a TCL
procedure. "<i>x"</i> specifies the name of the procedure. By convention, the
name of the COM file minus ".com".</ul><blockquote>Only one of PROGRAM,
SUBROUTINE, and PROCEDURE may be defined.
<a name="Heading26"></a><a name="_Toc429910613"></a></blockquote>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading6">2.2.2 Name List Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros list the files used in the imakefile. MODULE_LIST must always be given
for anything other than PROCEDURE. Others are optional. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>MODULE_LIST </b><i>l</i> - Specifies the list of source code modules.
The argument <i>l</i> is a space-separated list of filenames, including the
extensions. The extensions must match the language types in the supplied USES
macros. All files must be in the current directory, i.e. no path names. The
MODULE_LIST is used to specify the modules to compile, link, put in the
library, and clean (delete after the build). </ul><blockquote>Although some of
those functions can be overridden with other lists, normally only MODULE_LIST
will be used. MODULE_LIST must be defined. MODULE_LIST can only handle about
150 to 200 characters (2. 5 lines) worth of filenames. The limit is lower on
VMS than on UNIX.<br><br>
If you have more files than MODULE _LIST can handle by itself, use the list
extension macros MODULE_LIST2, MODULE_LIST3, and MODULE_LIST4. Define
MODULE_LIST in any case; the extensions are also used if present. They should
be used in order. Each of the extensions can handle about 200 characters. If
you need more than three extensions, contact the VICAR system programmer to add
more extensions. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>MODULE_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for MODULE_LIST. See
MODULE_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>MODULE_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for MODULE_LIST if
MODULE_LIST2 fills up. See MODULE_LIST.<br><br>
<li>	<b>MODULE_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for MODULE_LIST if
MODULE_LIST3 fills up. See MODULE_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>INCLUDE_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a space-separated
list of local include files, if any. All includes delivered with the .COM file
must be listed here, with the appropriate filename
extensions.</ul><blockquote>If there are no local includes, then do not define
INCLUDE_LIST. System includes, or includes from SUBLIB, should not be in the
list. This list is used for the source cleaning operation and makefile
dependencies. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>INCLUDE_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for INCLUDE_LIST. See
INCLUDE_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>INCLUDE_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for INCLUDE_LIST if
INCLUDE_LIST2 fills up. See INCLUDE_LIST.<br><br>
<li>	<b>INCLUDE_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for INCLUDE_LIST if
INCLUDE_LIST3 fills up. See INCLUDE_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>FTNINC_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a space-separated
list of FORTRAN system and SUBLIB includes used in the FORTRAN modules, if any.
All FORTRAN system and SUBLIB includes must be listed here, <i>without</i>
filename extensions.</ul><blockquote>If there are no FORTRAN system or SUBLIB
includes, then do not define FTNINC_LIST. This list is used to create logical
names or symbolic links to the includes before the compile step.
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_LIST</b> <i>l</i>  - The argument <i>l</i>is a space-separated
list of object files to delete (clean) after a compile. If not given, this list
defaults to the value for MODULE_LIST, so CLEAN_OBJ_LIST should be rarely
used.</ul><blockquote>The names in CLEAN_OBJ_LIST must have <i>source code</i>
filename extensions. vimake will convert them to standard object module names
automatically. CLEAN_OBJ_LIST may be extended with CLEAN_OBJ_LIST2,
CLEAN_OBJ_LIST3, and CLEAN_OBJ_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST. See
MODULE_LIST for details. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_OBJ_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST.
See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_OBJ_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST
if CLEAN_OBJ_-LIST2 fills up. See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_OBJ_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST
if CLEAN_OBJ_LIST3 fills up. See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_SRC_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a
space-separated list of source code to delete during a clean-source operation.
This happens during system builds. Since the source code just came from the COM
file, it does not need to be kept after the build. If not given, this list
defaults to the value for MODULE_LIST, so CLEAN_SRC_LIST should rarely if ever
be used. CLEAN_SRC_LIST may be extended with CLEAN_SRC_LIST2, CLEAN_SRC_LIST3,
and CLEAN_SRC_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST. See MODULE_LIST for
details. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_SRC_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST
if it is too big. See CLEAN_SRC_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_SRC_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST
if CLEAN_SRC_LIST2 fills up. See CLEAN_SRC_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_SRC_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST
if CLEAN_SRC_LIST3 fills up. See CLEAN_SRC_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>CLEAN_OTHER_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a
space-separated list of other files to clean during a clean-source operation.
After a clean-source is performed, only the files needed to execute the program
(usually the program itself and the PDF) and the original .COM file should
still exist in the directory.</ul><blockquote>If any files are unpacked or
created during the build process that are used only during the build process
and that not covered by MODULE_LIST or INCLUDE_LIST (or automatically deleted
as the .bld, .make, and .imakefiles are), then they should be listed in
CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.<br><br>
These files are typically source code files that are used only on other
machines, if MODULE_LIST or INCLUDE_LIST are defined conditionally. If there
are no extra files (the usual case), then do not define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST. There
are currently no extension macros defined for CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LINK_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a space-separated
list of object code modules to link, in the order they will appear in the link
statement. It is only valid for type PROGRAM. The object code modules must have
a ".o" extension, even for VMS (it is converted to ".obj"
automatically).</ul><blockquote>If not given, this list defaults to the value
for MODULE_LIST (which is automatically converted to object-name format), so
LINK_LIST should rarely be used. LINK_LIST may be extended with LINK_LIST2,
LINK_LIST3, and LINK_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST. See MODULE_LIST for
details. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LINK_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for LINK_LIST. See
LINK_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LINK_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for LINK_LIST if
LINK_LIST2 fills up. See LINK_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LINK_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for LINK_LIST if
LINK_LIST3 fills up. See LINK_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_LIST</b> <i>l</i> - The argument <i>l</i> is a space-separated list
of object code modules to put in the object code library. It is only valid for
type SUBROUTINE. The object code modules must have a ".o" extension, even for
VMS (it is converted to ".obj" automatically). If not given, this list defaults
to the value for MODULE_LIST (which is automatically converted to object-name
format), so LIB_LIST should rarely be used. LIB_LIST may be extended with
LIB_LIST2,LIB_LIST3, and LIB_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST. See
MODULE_LIST for details. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_LIST2</b> <i>l</i> - The first extension for LIB_LIST. See
LIB_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_LIST3</b> <i>l</i> - The second extension for LIB_LIST if LIB_LIST2
fills up. See LIB_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_LIST4</b> <i>l</i> - The third extension for LIB_LIST if LIB_LIST3
fills up. See LIB_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>SCRIPT_LIST</b> - List of script files (and extensions). Similar to
LINK_LIST, in that it is derived from MODULE_LIST normally and SCRIPT_LIST is
an override. </ul><blockquote>SCRIPT_LIST is not implemented on VMS though, so
it should not be set by the user (i.e. use MODULE_LIST). Scripts are "built"
depending on the type of script, often nothing but a chmod +x is done to them,
but it depends on the script type. They're all listed in various USES_x below.
Scripts should only be defined for type PROCEDURE (as opposed to PROGRAM or
SUBROUTINE). Note that if a PROCEDURE has no MODULE_LIST, it automatically gets
"PROCEDURE.pdf" where PROCEDURE is the name defined in the PROCEDURE #define.
This is for backwards compatibility. So for example, pdf procedure imake's
should now #define MODULE_LIST x.pdf and also #define USES_PDF.
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>SCRIPT_LIST2</b> - <i>l</i> - The first extension for SCRIPT_LIST. See
SCRIPT_LIST.<br><br>
<li>	<b>SCRIPT_LIST3</b> - <i>l</i> - The second extension for SCRIPT_LIST if
SCRIPT_LIST2 fills up. See SCRIPT_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>SCRIPT_LIST4</b> - <i>l</i> - The third extension for SCRIPT_LIST if
SCRIPT_LIST3 fills up. See SCRIPT_LIST. <br><br>
<li>	<b>SYMBOL_LIST</b> - Optional list of symbols which should be externally
visible in the shared library. The SYMBOL_LIST elements should be defined using
the SYMBOL and FSYMBOL macros:</ul>

<pre>
#define SYMBOL_LIST SYMBOL(zvzinit) SYMBOL(zzinit) \<br><br>SYMBOL(zvpinit) SYMBOL(zv_rtl_init) SYMBOL(sc2for) SYMBOL(sc2for_array)\<br><br>SYMBOL(sfor2c) SYMBOL(sfor2c_array) SYMBOL(sfor2len) SYMBOL(sfor2ptr) \<br><br>FSYMBOL(abend) SYMBOL(zabend) FSYMBOL(qprint) SYMBOL(zqprint) \<br><br>FSYMBOL(xladd) SYMBOL(zladd) FSYMBOL(xldel) SYMBOL(zldel) \<br><br>...
</pre>
<blockquote>Where
SYMBOL defines a C symbol, and FSYMBOL defines a Fortran-callable symbol
(underscores are added where necessary). See for example librtl.com or
librtlf.com in rtl, or for a smaller one, script_glue.com in gui/prog.
<a name="Heading27"></a><a name="_Toc429910614"></a></blockquote>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading7">2.2.3 Main Language Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define the language of the main program. One and only one of these must
be present for type PROGRAM. They are not needed for any other type.
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>MAIN_LANG_C</b> - If defined, the main program is written in C. Valid
only for type PROGRAM. The main program is defined as the <tt>main44()</tt>
subroutine for most VICAR programs, or <tt>main()</tt> if the program doesn't
use the standard VICAR startup routines. For programs, one and only one of
MAIN_LANG_C, MAIN_LANG_C_PLUS_PLUS and MAIN_LANG_ FORTRAN must be defined. Use
MAIN_LANG_C for C++, K&amp;R C and ANSI C. <br><br>
<li>	<b>MAIN_LANG_C_PLUS_PLUS</b> - Main language is C++, similar to
MAIN_LANG_C.<br><br>
<li>	<b> MAIN_ LANG_FORTRAN </b>- If defined, the main program is written in
FORTRAN. The main program is defined as the <tt>main44</tt> subroutine for most
VICAR programs, or the <tt>main</tt> subroutine if the program doesn't use the
standard VICAR startup routines. For programs, one and only one of MAIN_LANG_C
and MAIN_LANG_ FORTRAN must be defined. 
<a name="Heading28"></a><a name="_Toc429910615"></a></ul>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading8">2.2.4 Languages Used Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define which languages are used by source files in this imakefile. All
the "USES_*" macros indicate that the named language is used in MODULE_LIST;
the extension indicates which language it is (e.g. .cc is C++, .c is C, .csh is
C-shell, etc.).</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>USES_ANSI_C</b> - If defined, at least one source module is written in
ANSI- standard C, as opposed to the older Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) C.
Most VICAR code is currently written in K&amp;R C, although it is recommended
that new code be written in ANSI C.</ul><blockquote>USES_ANSI_C may or may not
accept non-ANSI constructs, depending on the machine implementation, but it
should generate warnings if non-ANSI constructs are used. USES_ANSI_C is valid
for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. If any C code is to be compiled, either
USES_C or USES_ANSI_C must be defined, but not both.<br><br>
Only one version of C may be used at a time, so all of the C modules in the
imakefile must be either ANSI or K&amp;R C. All C source modules must have a
filename extension of ". c". Any number of other USES flags may be defined, if
needed. All C modules have the RTL and TAE include files available. Other
include directories can included via the LIB macros or the class macros (R2LIB,
P2_SUBLIB, etc.). main programs written in ANSI C still use the MAIN_LANG_C
macro. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>USES_BASH</b> - Bourne-again shell scripts. Renames from x.bash to x
and chmod +x's. Unix only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_C</b> - At least one source module is written in C, using
Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) C, as opposed to ANSI C. Most VICAR code is
written using K&amp;R C, so be the flag used most often. USES_C may or may not
accept some ANS I code, depending on the machine, but if there is any conflict
then the K&amp;R interpretation will be used.</ul><blockquote>USES_C is valid
for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. If any C code is to be compiled, either
USES_C or USES_ANSI_C must be defined, but not both. Only one version of C may
be used at a time, so all of the C modules in the imakefile must be either ANSI
or K&amp;R C. All C source modules must have a filename extension of ".c". Any
number of other USES flags may be defined, if needed. All C modules have the
RTL and TAE include files available. Other include directories can be included
via the LIB macros or the class macros(R2LIB, P2_SUBLIB, etc.).
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>USES_CSH</b> - C-shell scripts. Renames from x.csh to x and chmod +x's.
Unix only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_C_PLUS_PLUS</b> - At least one source module is written in C++.
All C++ source modules must have a filename extension of ".cc".<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_DCL </b>- Renames the file from x.dcl to x.com on VMS only.
Ignored on Unix. Note that DCL scripts must be delivered with ".dcl" extension
to distinguish them from vpack's .com files, but the build renames them so they
are runnable.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_EXTRACT</b> - Used in librtlf only. It indicates that MODULE_LIST
contains EXTRACT or EXTRACT_TAE macros. These pull individual *.o's out of a
library (as opposed to the whole library), and are useful for generating shared
libraries, where you want to include a specific *.o but not the whole library.
The syntax is EXTRACT(module, libname) where module is the name of the module
to extract (with the .o), and libname is the name of the library to extract
from (without the "lib" part). For example:</ul>

<pre>
#define MODULE_LIST EXTRACT(xvzinit.o,rtl) \ EXTRACT_TAE(xqgenbr.o,tae) EXTRACT_TAE(xqtaskbr.o,tae)
</pre>
<blockquote>The
only difference between EXTRACT and EXTRACT_TAE is that EXTRACT looks for its
library in $V2OLB (v2$olb), while EXTRACT_TAE looks in $TAELIB
($taelib).</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>USES_ FORTRAN </b>- If defined, at least one source module is written
in FORTRAN. It is valid for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. If any FORTRAN code
is to be compiled, USES_ FORTRAN must be defined. All FORTRAN source modules
must have a filename extension of ". f". Any number of USES flags may be
defined, if needed. <br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_KSH</b> - Korn-shell scripts. Renames from x.ksh to x and chmod
+x's. Unix only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_MACRO</b> - If defined, at least one source module is written in
VAX Macro. It is valid for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. If any VAX Macro code
is to be assembled, USES_MACRO must be defined.</ul><blockquote>VAX Macro code
is not portable, so in a portable application a portable version of the same
function must be available. Typically, MODULE_LIST will be defined differently
for the VMS and UNIX versions (see the examples in the previous Section). All
VAX Macro source modules must have a filename extension of ".mar". Any number
of USES flags may be defined, if needed. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>USES_PDF</b> - PDF scripts, filename extensin of ".pdf". Does nothing
with them (at least at the moment, future enhancement might automatically run
the pdf-&gt;html help converter, or something like that).<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_PERL</b> - Perl scripts. On Unix, renames x.perl or x.pl to x and
chmod +x's. Does nothing on VMS, i.e. VMS works with Perl scripts but the build
doesn't do anything to them (no renames).<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_SH</b> - Bourne-shell scripts. Renames from x.sh to x and chmod
+x's. Unix only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_TCL_TK</b> - Tcl/Tk scripts, with extension ".tcl". Runs
"auto_mkindex" in the directory, which generates the index file that tcl needs
to find the scripts. This should work on VMS too, but this compile step is not
yet implemented.<br><br>
<li>	<b>USES_VFC</b> - If defined, at least one source module is written in the
VFC array processor language. It is valid for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. If
any VFC code is to be compiled, USES_VFC must be defined.</ul><blockquote>At
the present time, VFC code is not portable, so in a portable application a
portable version of the same function must be available. Typically, MODULE_LIST
will be defined differently for the VMS and UNIX versions. All VFC source
modules must have a filename extension of ".vfc". Any number of USES flags may
be defined, if needed. 
<a name="Heading29"></a><a name="_Toc429910616"></a></blockquote>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading9">2.2.5 Build Flag Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros set up various flags for the compilation or link steps. Define them as
needed. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>FTN_STRING</b> - If defined,  indicates that one or more of the FORTRAN
string conversion routines are called by any routine in the program unit. It is
valid for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. The FORTRAN string routines are
<b>sc2for</b>, <b>sc2for_array</b>, <b>sfor2c</b>, <b>sfor2c_array</b>,
<b>sfor2len</b>, and <b>sfor2ptr</b> .</ul><blockquote>They are available only
from C. Some operating systems (notably Sun-4) require that modules using these
routines be compiled with a lower level of optimization. If none of the string
conversion routines are called, then do not define this flag. FTN_STRING must
be defined if a C routine merely accepts a FORTRAN string, even if a subroutine
ultimately calls the conversion routine. The same routine normally accepts the
string and calls the conversion routine. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>C_ OPTIONS</b> <i>x</i> -The argument <i>x</i> defines extra options
that are to be given to the C compiler. If no options are needed, do not define
C_ OPTIONS. It is valid only in conjunction with the USES_C or USES_ANSI_C
flags. The argument <i>x</i> may be in any format the C compiler allows, and
may include spaces. There is no translation performed on the options, so they
are machine dependent.</ul><blockquote>C_ OPTIONS is intended for program
development use only. A program or subroutine should not be delivered with C_
OPTIONS defined. If it is, the C_OPTIONS must be defined in a machine-dependent
conditional. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>CCC_TEMPLATES</b> - Flag indicating that the module uses C++ templates.
For VMS only, you need a #pragma in the source file to indicate template
instantiation, which must be in one and only one module that uses a particular
template instantiation (you should use a symbol such as TEMPLATE_PRAGMA_NEEDED
instead of checking for VMS specifically):</ul>

<pre>
#pragma define_template SL_List&lt;SptParamBase *&gt;
</pre>
<blockquote>The
template's .h file should include the .cc file for VMS and AXP_UNIX.
Appropriate symbols have not yet been defined system wide; contact the VICAR
System Programmer for assistance if you need to use this.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>FORTRAN_OPTIONS</b> <i>x</i> - The argument<i> x</i> defines extra
options that are to be given to the FORTRAN compiler. If no options are needed,
do not define FORTRAN_OPTIONS. It is valid only in conjunction with the
USES_FORTRAN flag. The argument <i>x</i> may be in any format the FORTRAN
compiler allows, and may include spaces. There is no translation performed on
the options, so they are machine dependent.</ul><blockquote>FORTRAN_OPTIONS is
intended for program development use only. A program or subroutine not be
delivered with FORTRAN_OPTIONS defined. If it is, the FORTRAN_OPTIONS must be
defined in a machine-dependent conditional. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LINK_OPTIONS</b> <i>x</i> - The argument <i>x</i> defines extra options
that are to be given to the linker. If no options are needed, do not define
LINK_ OPTIONS. The argument <i>x</i> maybe in any format the linker allows, and
may include spaces. There is no translation performed on the options, so they
are machine dependent.</ul><blockquote>Under VMS, the options are placed after
any vimake-generated options; under UNIX the options are placed at the
beginning of the command line. LINK_ OPTIONS is intended for program
development use only. A program or subroutine should not be delivered with
LINK_ OPTIONS defined. If it is, the LINK_ OPTIONS must be defined in a
machine-dependent conditional.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>DEBUG</b> - If defined, causes the makefile to be built for debugging.
It is valid for PROGRAMs and SUBROUTINEs only. It is not needed under VMS, or
on some versions of UNIX (like the Sun). It is only needed for certain
varieties of UNIX (though you can use it on any system) that do not have
conditional macros in their versions of <tt>make</tt>. For these machines,  set
DEBUG in the imakefile, and rerun vimake, to build a program for the
debugger.</ul><blockquote>For UNIX machines that do have conditional macros,
simply use the "debug" target in the standard generated makefile; the DEBUG
flag is not needed. For VMS, you can use the "DEBUG" secondary option in the
standard build file, so the DEBUG flag is not needed. A program or subroutine
should never be delivered with DEBUG defined. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>PROFILE</b> - If defined, causes the makefile to be built for
profiling. It is valid for PROGRAMs and SUBROUTINEs only. It is not needed
under VMS, or on some versions of UNIX (like the Sun). It is only needed for
certain varieties of UNIX (though you can use it on any system) that do not
have conditional macros in their versions of<tt> make</tt>. For these machines,
set PROFILE in the imakefile, and rerun vimake, to build a program for the
profiler.</ul><blockquote>For UNIX machines that do have conditional macros,
you can simply use the "profile" target in the standard generated makefile, so
the PROFILE flag is not needed. For VMS, you can use the "PROFILE" secondary
option in the standard build file, so the PROFILE flag is not needed. A program
or subroutine should never be delivered with PROFILE defined. 
<a name="Heading30"></a></blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>SHARED_LIBRARY</b> - Instructs vimake to build a shared library,
instead of a normal program. Should be used with type PROGRAM.
<a name="_Toc429910617"></a></ul>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading10">2.2.6 Program Class Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define what class the program is in. Valid for type PROGRAM only. They
specify how to link the library for PROGRAM. One (and only one) of these must
be defined.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>MPFLIB</b> - Mars Pathfinder application. Like R2LIB for MPF
programs.<br><br>
<li>	<b>R1LIB</b> - Class 1 VICAR application, makes the class 1 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>GUILIB</b> - GUI application.<br><br>
<li>	<b>R2LIB</b> - Class 2 VICAR application, makes the class 1 and 2 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>R3LIB</b> - Class 3 VICAR application, makes the class 1, 2 and 3
SUBLIB includes available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>HWLIB</b> - HW application, specific to the Mars '96 project, makes the
HW includes available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>TEST</b> - Test application.
<a name="_Toc429910618"></a></ul>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading11">2.2.7 Subroutine Class Macros</A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define what class the subroutine is in. Valid for type SUBROUTINE only.
They specify how to link the library for SUBROUTINE. One (and only one) of
these must be defined.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>MPF_SUBLIB</b> - Mars Pathfinder application. Like P2_SUBLIB for MPF
subroutines.<br><br>
<li>	<b>P1_SUBLIB</b> - Class 1 portable VICAR subroutine, makes the class 1
SUBLIB includes available to the compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>P2_SUBLIB</b> - Class 2 portable VICAR subroutine, makes the class 1
and 2 SUBLIB includes available to the compiler.<br><br>

<A NAME="Heading12">2.2.8 Documentation Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros describe documentation that must be built. Use them if needed.
</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>TAE_ERRMSG</b> <i>x</i> - The value <i>x</i> is the name of the TAE
error message file, if present, without extension. This file provides help on
error messages generated by the program, and is called a "doc" file by the
application packer program.</ul><blockquote>The file must be named according t
o standard TAE conventions: " <i>name</i> fac.msg", where <i>name</i> is the
facility part of the message key (the part before the "-"), usually the name of
the program. The value <i>x</i> must not include the ".msg" extension. So,
TAE_ERRMSG might be set to "sffac" or "bidrsfac". The message files are built
with the TAE program <tt>msgbld</tt>. 
<a name="Heading32"></a><a name="_Toc429910620"></a></blockquote>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading13">2.2.9 Library Macros </A></h3>

<blockquote>These
macros define the libraries needed for the compile and link steps. LIB_*'s
specify how to link the library for PROGRAM, and where to find include files to
both PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. Almost all PROGRAMs and some SUBROUTINEs will
define several. Define as many as are needed. They are not useful for type
PROCEDURE. LOCAL_LIBRARY is special so it is listed first; the others are in
alphabetical order. <br><br>
See<A HREF="http://rushmore.JPL.NASA.GOV/install/externalsoftware_old.html" TARGET="_top">http://rushmore.JPL.NASA.GOV/install/externalsoftware_old.html</A>
 for a list of external software packages (below) with infomation about
each.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LOCAL_INCLUDE</b> - Allow -I to be manually specified in imake file.
Should be used only for testing, NEVER in a delivery. Similar to LOCAL_LIBRARY
(below).<br><br>
<li>	<b>LOCAL_LIBRARY</b><i>x</i> - The argument <i>x</i> defines the name of
the local library to use. It is defined in a system-specific manner, so it will
have to be #if'd based on the operating system. The default if LOCAL_LIBRARY is
not defined (the normal case) is "sublib.olb" for VMS and "sublib.a" for UNIX.
LOCAL_LIBRARY is used differently for PROGRAMs and
SUBROUTINEs.</ul><blockquote>For SUBROUTINEs, LOCAL_LIBRARY is the name of the
object library that the modules are inserted into during a non-system build
(system builds go directly to the appropriate system library). This is
typically used during development and debugging.<br><br>
For PROGRAMs, LOCAL_LIBRARY is the name of the object library included in the
link statement when the LIB_LOCAL flag is set. It is used only during
development and debugging. A program or subroutine is never delivered with
LOCAL_LIBRARY defined, since the program or subroutine must build in
directories other than yours. LOCAL_LIBRARY is provided merely as a convenience
during program development. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_ACE_WRAPPERS</b> - ACE external library,<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_CANDELA</b> - Candela external library. Proprietary, for Sun4
only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_C_NOSHR</b> - Normally the program is automatically linked to the C
run-time library as a shared library or a VMS shareable image, and no flag need
be given. The C_NOSHR flag, if defined, links the C run-time library as a
standard link library instead.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_C3JPEG</b> - Obsolete. Library for the C Cubed JPEG decompression
board. LIB_C3JPEG also makes the C3JPEG library includes available to the C
compiler.</ul><blockquote>LIB_C3JPEG is not available on all platforms.
Currently, it is available only on Sun-4 platforms, as the library is
hardware-dependent. If the library is not available (specified by the
C3JPEG_AVAIL_OS flag defined in xvmaininc.h), then the LIB_C3JPEG flag is
ignored.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_CPLT</b> - Obsolete. Common Plotting Package library. The Common
Plotting Package is currently available under VMS only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_CURSES</b> - CURSES package, a set of subroutines for handling
navigation on a terminal screen using the cursor.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_DALI</b> - GEM external library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_DD_PLUS_PLUS</b> - DD++ external library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_DTR</b> - Obsolete. VMS Datatrieve database shareable image. The
DTR library is available under VMS only. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_ FORTRAN </b>- FORTRAN run-time library. This flag should <i>only
</i>be used if MAIN_LANG_C is set; the FORTRAN library is included
automatically for MAIN_LANG_ FORTRAN .</ul><blockquote>The LIB_ FORTRAN flag is
needed when linking a C main program to a subroutine written in FORTRAN that
uses I/O statements (such as WRITE to a string). This subroutine may be hidden
in a library such as P2SUB, so if you get unexplained link errors, you may need
this flag.<br><br>
The FORTRAN library is automatically included under VMS (flag is ignored), so
you will not know if you need it unless you link the program on a UNIX
system</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_FPS</b> - Obsolete. FPS routines for the VMS array processor. The
FPS library is currently available under VMS only. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_HWSUB</b> - portable HW (Mars '94/'96 specific) subroutine library.
This flag also makes HW includes available to the C compiler. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_HWSUB_DEBUG</b> - debuggable version of the portable HW (Mars
'94/'96 specific) subroutine library. A program should not be delivered with
HWSUB_DEBUG. For program development and maintenance only.</ul><blockquote>The
HWSUB_DEBUG library has not yet been implemented. This flag also makes the HW
includes available to the C compiler.</blockquote><ul>
<li><b>	LIB_KERBEROS </b>- Kerberos Version 4 libraries. This flag should be
defined for programs that define the LIB_MDMS, and use the MDMS DBMS Query
Interface libary (QI).<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_KERBEROS5</b> - Kerberos Version 5 libraries. This flag should be
defined for programs that use FEI version 3.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_LOCAL</b> - Local library defined in LOCAL_LIBRARY (or the default
local library). It is valid only for type PROGRAM. A program should never be
delivered with LIB_LOCAL defined, since the program must link in directories
other than yours. LIB_LOCAL is provided merely as a convenience during program
development. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MATH77</b> - MATH77 mathematics subroutine library. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MATRACOMP</b> - Obsolete. Matra compression library. This library
is proprietary code supplied by Matra for use with the Mars '96
project.</ul><blockquote>LIB_MATRACOMP is currently available only on Sun-4
platforms. If the library is not available, then the LIB_MATRACOMP flag is
ignored. As a temporary measure, the C3JPEG_AVAIL_OS flag defined in
xvmaininc.h may be used to determine availability of the Matra software. This
will change in the future (when linkgroups for subroutines are implemented), so
if you use C3JPEG_AVAIL_OS for the Matra library, put in a comment marking this
usage as temporary. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_MDMS</b> - MDMS (Multimission Data Management Subsystem) client
library. This flag also makes the MDMS includes available to the C
compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MDMS_FEI</b> - MDMS FEI (File Exchange Interface) library. This
flag also makes the FEI includes available to the C compiler. LIB_MDMS_FEI may
be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MDMS_FEI_3</b> - File Exchange Interface (FEI) client library.
Currently, you must also define LIB_KERBEROS5, and LIB_PTHREAD to use the FEI_3
library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MOTIFAPP</b> - The MotifApp library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MOTIF</b> - X-windows and Motif libraries, specifically X11, Xt,
and Xm. This flag also makes the X and Motif includes available to the C
compiler. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MPFSUB</b> - Mars Pathfinder library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_MPFSUB_DEBUG</b> - Mars Pathfinder debug library. Not implemented
under UNIX.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_NETWORK</b> - network support libraries, including RPC's (Remote
Procedure Calls) and sockets. This flag also makes the network includes
available to the C compiler. </ul><blockquote>Currently, the Multinet network
support libraries for VMS require a different include syntax. For example,
instead of "rpc/rpc.h" the syntax would simply be "rpc.h". A conditional
compile should take care of this. It is hoped that this difference will be
resolved in the future. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_ NETWORK</b>_<b>NOSHR</b> - non-shareable version of the network
support libraries. It is otherwise identical to LIB_NETWORK. LIB_NETWORK_NOSHR
is needed if the PVM libraries are used. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_NIMSCAL</b> - NIMS calibration library. The NIMS calibration
library is currently available under VMS only. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_PDS</b> - Current PDS (Planetary Data System) label library,

<li>	<b>LIB_PDS_LABEL</b> - Deprecated. Old PDS (Planetary Data System) label
library.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_PVM</b> - PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) library. This flag also
makes the PVM includes available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_P1SUB</b> - portable class 1 SUBLIB library. This flag also makes
the class 1 SUBLIB includes available to the C compiler. <br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_P1SUB_DEBUG</b> - debuggable version of the portable class 1 SUBLIB
library. A program should never be delivered with P1SUB_DEBUG, as it is
intended for program development and maintenance only .</ul><blockquote>The
P1SUB_DEBUG library has not yet been implemented. This flag also makes the
class 1 SUBLIB includes available to the C compiler.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_P2SUB</b> - portable SUBLIB library. If you link toP2SUB, you may
<i>not</i> link to S2 or S3. This flag also makes the class 2 SUBLIB includes
available to the C compiler.<br><br>
<li>	<b>LIB_P2SUB_DEBUG</b> - debuggable version of the portable SUBLIB
library. If you link to P2SUB_DEBUG, you may <i>not</i> link to S2 or S3. A
program should never be delivered with P2SUB_DEBUG, as it is intended for

library has not yet been implemented. This flag also makes the class 2 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.</blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>LIB_P3SUB</b> - portable class 3 SUBLIB library. If you link to P3SUB,
you may <i>not</i> link to S2 or S3. This flag also makes the class 3SUBLIB
