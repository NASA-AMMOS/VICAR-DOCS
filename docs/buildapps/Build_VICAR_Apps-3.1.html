3.1 vpack </H2>
<blockquote>The vpack program accepts a list of parameters: </blockquote>

<pre>
vpack &lt;file.com&gt;  [-u]<br>                  [-s Source file(s)]<br>                  [-i IMAKE template file(s)]<br>                  [-b VMS build file(s)]<br>                  [-m UNIX make file(s)]<br>                  [-p PDF file(s)]<br>                  [-t Test file(s)]<br>                  [-d Documentation file(s)]<br>                  [-o "Other" file(s)]
</pre>
<blockquote>The
" <tt>-b</tt>" (VMS build file) and " <tt>-m</tt>" (UNIX makefile) should not
be used. The " <tt>-i</tt>" (i makefile) option should be used instead.
Machine-specific build files are allowed only under rare circumstances.<br><br>
The " <tt>-u</tt> " option tells vpack that the module is unportable
(VMS-specific), so the correct header information can be generated (the default
for executing the COM file directly with no arguments is changed from "STD" to
"SYS"). If vpack is used with unportable module s, "<tt>-u</tt>" must be
present; for portable modules, it must not be. <br><br>
If you call the vpack program with no parameters, it will report a syntax error
and give the proper syntax to use. <br><br>
Based on the parameters provided, the vpack program will create the new COM
file (named in the first argument), read the lists of files in the order given,
and append them to the new COM file. None of the source files are altered or
deleted. vpack's output is the COM (ASCII) file. The vpack program requires
that the COM filename be included as a parameter and also requires that at
least one list of files be specified. <br><br>
As an example, the command necessary to assemble the Magellan program
<tt>view</tt> into a COM file is: </blockquote>

<pre>
vpack view.com -s view.h host.c image.c overlap.c view.c<br>               -i view.imake<br>               -p view.pdf<br>               -t tstview.pdf tstview.scr
</pre>
<blockquote><tt>A</tt>n
include file (view.h) is considered a "source" file. Multiple file names can be
separated by commas or spaces or both. If you arrange the command on several
lines, you would need a continuation character appropriate for the operating
system you are using. <br><br>
The vpack program can be executed in two different ways. The command can be
executed directly from the command line as shown above, assuming the command
line is long enough to hold the entire command. It can also be executed from a
repack file created by the vpack program. For example, the repack file created
for the <tt>view </tt>program is as follows:</blockquote>

<pre>
$ vpack view.com -<br>        -s view.h host.c image.c overlap.c view.c -<br>        -i view.imake -<br>        -p view.pdf -<br>        -t tstview.pdf tstview.scr<br>$Exit 
</pre>
<blockquote>The
preferred method for executing the vpack program also uses the repack file, but
as a parameter to the program:</blockquote>

<pre>
vpack view.repack
</pre>
<blockquote>There
is no command line length limit with this method. </blockquote><p>The vpack
program creates a COM file in the following format: </p>
<ul>
<li>	A standard header which lists all of the available parameters and options
for the COM file in the VMS environment as comments. This header also lists the
version number of the vpack program which created the file and the name of the
file. See below for an example of a header. <br><br>
<li>	DCL code which parses command-line options in the VMS environment and sets
up the necessary conditions to execute the user's instructions. For example, if
the user typed "<tt>@file.com source</tt> ", the source files from the COM file
would be created. <br><br>
<li>	A repack file which can be used by the vpack program or can be used
stand-alone (under VMS only) to repack the COM file after making changes to the
files which comprise it. <br><br>
<li>	The various sections of files which make up the COM file: source file(s),
PDF file(s), etc. Each section consists of a label header ("$Source_File:"),
followed by the files within the Section .</ul><blockquote>If the COM file
includes an imakefile for use with vimake, the COM file header options will
include many of the options utilized by the generated build file: COMPILE, ALL,
SYSTEM, CLEAN, etc.). The vpack program is designed to adjust the header
options based on the type of files included.<br><br>
If only source files are assembled into the COM file, then the only options
listed in the header will be those which unpack the various files - such
options as compiling and linking will not be included. If the COM file does not
include a PDF file, then the option to unpack the PDF file is omitted from the
COM file, and so on. <br><br>
A typical header for the <tt>view</tt> program, is shown below. Since the
<tt>view</tt> program includes source files, a PDF file, test files, and an
imakefile, all of these options are listed in the header file. The various
options for the COM file are only available under VMS. The options are
discussed in greater detail below. For further in formation on the use of
vimake and the build options, see <A HREF="Build_VICAR_Apps-2.html">2</A>

<blockquote>
The following options are only available when the COM file is executed under
VMS. To unpack files from the COM file in the UNIX environment, the companion
program vunpack must be used.<br><br>
Many of these options for build will not typically be used. The recommended way
of modifying an application is to unpack it, change it, and repack the results
when it's ready for delivery. The same options are available on the
vimake-generated BLD file. The COM file may be edited directly without
unpacking, in which case these options could be useful. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>COMP</b>ile: The compile option is only available when the program's
files include an imakefile created for use with the vimake utility. This option
causes the COM file to create the source file(s) and the imakefile, if
necessary. vimake is called to create the appropriate VMS BLD file. The COM
file then executes the BLD file to carry out the compile command. This option
also has several secondary options: <br><br>
<li>	<b>DEB</b>ug: Compile for debug ( <tt>/debug/noopt</tt>) <br><br>
<li>	<b>PROfile</b>: Compile for PCA ( <tt>/debug</tt>) <br><br>
<li>	<b>LISt</b>: Generate a list file ( <tt>/list</tt>) <br><br>
<li>	<b>LISTALL</b>: Generate a full list ( <tt>/show=all</tt>) (implies LIST)
</ul><blockquote>If, for example, you wish to compile the modules for
debugging, the appropriate syntax for executing the COM file would
be:</blockquote>

<pre>
@view comp deb 
</pre>
<blockquote>If
you wanted to generate a list file as well:</blockquote>

<pre>
@view comp deb,list 
</pre>
<blockquote>Secondary
options are separated by commas, no spaces. <br><br>
The command above would generate debuggable versions of the object file(s) for
the program. To create the executable, you would still need to call the BLD
file with the "LINK DEBUG" parameters. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>ALL</b>: Builds a private version of the executable in the default
directory. By default, no secondary options are used. Since the ALL option
carries out the COMPILE command, it accepts the same secondary options
described above. The ALL option also unpacks the PDF and documentation files
and calls the BLD file to carry out additional processing of the documentation
files. <br><br>
<li>	<b>STD</b>: Carries out the same actions as the ALL command, with the
exception that documentation files are not unpacked and generated. STD is the
default option for portable modules (without the " <tt>-u</tt>" flag for
vpack). <br><br>
<li>	<b>SYS</b>tem: Builds the system version of the executable and executes
the CLEAN option as well. None of the secondary options are activated for the
COMPILE and LINK commands, while the CLEAN command has both OBJ and SRC
secondary options activated. Additionally, the PDF and documentation files are
unpacked and any additional processing of the documentation files needed is
carried out.</ul><p>This command should only be executed by Configuration
Management. This option is the default (for compatibility reasons) if the
"<tt>-u</tt>" (unportable) flag is passed to vpack. </p>
<ul>
<li>	<b>CLEAN</b>: Deletes and/or purges files from the disk, depending on
which secondary options are selected. If the OBJ option is selected, the
command deletes any object and list files and purges the executable. This is
the default secondary option for the CLEAN command. If the SRC option is
selected, the source, imakefile, and build file are deleted. Make sure the COM
file is up to date before deleting the files that make it up.
</ul><blockquote>The remaining COM file options select the files unpacked from
the COM file. This gives you complete control over which files are removed from
the COM file. When the files are unpacked from the COM file, the COM file
itself remains unaltered. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>UNPACK</b>: All files are created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>REPACK</b>: Only the repackfile is created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>SOURCE</b>: only the source files are created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>PDF</b>: Only the PDF file is created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>TEST</b>: Only the test files are created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>DOC</b>: Only the documentation files are created. <br><br>
<li>	<b>IMAKE</b>: Only the imakefile (used with the vimake program) is
created. </ul><blockquote>Since the COM file created by vpack is an ASCII text
file, it is editable by the user. We recommend you follow the normal procedure
of unpacking the file(s), making and testing the necessary modifications, then
using vpack to rebuild the COM file.
