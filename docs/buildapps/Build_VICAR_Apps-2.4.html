2.4 Using the Generated UNIX makefile </H2>
<blockquote>Since most VICAR programmers may not be familiar with
<tt>make</tt>, this Section briefly describes how to use it. For more details
on using <tt>make</tt>, see the documentation for it.<br><br>
A makefile describes the dependencies between parts of an application and how
to build those parts to create the output program. Dependencies are simply the
files that are needed to build a piece of the program. For example, the
executable depends on all the object files and the link libraries it needs.
Each object file depends on its corresponding source file, and the include
files that it uses. A link library depends on the object files that make it
up.<br><br>
Source code may depend on a preprocessor, such as <tt>lex</tt> or
<tt>yacc</tt>, or may come from a source code management system. All these
dependencies can be tracked by <tt>make</tt>. <tt>make</tt> is designed to
figure out what needs to be built based on what has changed, and to build only
changed files. So, if you modify only one source module, <tt>make</tt> checks
the modification dates, realizes only one module has changed, and recompiles
only that module. <br><br>
The vimake-generated makefile takes advantage of many of these features. It
does not allow specifying which include files are used by which source files,
but since VICAR applications are typically small, this should not cause a
problem, but just require a few extra compiles. Full automatic dependency
checking may be added to the makefile in the future. <br><br>
By default, <tt>make</tt> looks for several filenames for the makefile,
including " makefile" and " makefile". The generated makefile is always named "
<i>file</i>.make" where <i>file</i> is the name of the application. Pass the "
<tt>-f</tt>" option to <tt>make</tt> to specify the name of the makefile.
<br><br>
If you are developing a program, you may rename the file "makefile" (or create
a symbolic link) so <tt>make</tt> will find it automatically. This precludes
having more than one application in the same directory, so it should not be
done all the time.<br><br>
To run <tt>make</tt>, use the following syntax:</blockquote>

<pre>
 make -f file. make targets
</pre>
<blockquote>where
"file" is the name of the application and "targets" is an optional list of
targets to build (described below). <br><br>
<tt>make</tt> operates through the use of targets. A target is the final result
of the <tt>make</tt>. A target could be an object file name, in which case that
file would be compiled. It could be the executable name, in which case all the
compiles and links necessary to create the executable are performed. There are
special targets, such as "all" or "clean.src", that cause other actions to be
performed. More than one target may be given on the same command, separated by
spaces. <br><br>
The targets available depend on whether you are building a PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE,
or PROCEDURE, and on how complex the build is. The allowed targets are listed
below. Not all targets will be available in all generated makefiles. <br><br>
There are fewer options on the UNIX makefile than there are on the VMS BLD
file. This is largely due to the fact that <tt>make</tt> takes care of a lot of
the details for you. You generally don't need to specify compiling a single
module, or only doing the link, because <tt>make</tt> will determine what needs
to be done and do it for you. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>std</b>: Builds a private version (" standard ") of the unit in the
current directory. It is the default target if none is given. It is valid for
PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and PROCEDURE. For type SUBROUTINE, the modules are
installed in the local link library (see library.local). <br><br>
<li>	<b>all</b>: Builds a private version of the unit in the current directory,
including the documentation. It is valid for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and
PROCEDURE. For type SUBROUTINE, the modules are installed in the local link
library (see library.local). <br><br>
<li>	<b>debug</b>: Builds a debuggable version of the unit ("<tt>-g</tt>"
option to the compiler). This target is only available on machines with
conditional macros in <tt>make</tt>, such as a Sun. On machines without
conditional macros, debug is not a valid target. To build the program for
debugging on these machines,  set the DEBUG flag in the imakefile, and re-run
vimake. When available, the debug target is valid for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.
<br><br>
<li>	<b>profile</b>: Builds a version of the unit for use with the profiler ("
<tt>-pg</tt>" option to the compiler). This target is only available on
machines with conditional macros in <tt>make</tt>, such as a Sun. On machines
without conditional macros, profile is not a valid target. To build the program
for use with the profiler on these machines,  set the PROFILE flag in the
imakefile, and re-run vimake. When available, the profile target is valid for
PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. <br><br>
<li>	<b>system</b>: Performs a system build of the unit. This target should
only be used by Configuration Management to build the VICAR system. It is valid
for PROGRAM, SUBROUTIN E, and PROCEDURE. The system target performs a clean.src
operation, which will delete the source code (since it just came from the
COMfile, it's not needed any more). <br><br>
<li>	<b>compile</b>: Compiles all the source code, but does not link or install
the objects in a library. It is valid for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE. <br><br>
<li>	<b>Object module name</b>: The name of an object module (with ".o"
extension) may be given to compile only one module. This is valid for PROGRAM
and SUBROUTINE. Specifying an object module name is not particularly useful,
since<tt> make</tt> already determines which modules need to be compiled. This
option will rarely be used. <br><br>
<li>	<b>Executable name</b>: The name of the program itself may be used as a
target, for type PROGRAM only. It is equivalent to the target "std". <br><br>
<li>	<b>library.local</b>: Installs the object code in the local (private)
library. The name of the library may be specified with the LOCAL_LIBRARY macro
in the imakefile. The modules are compiled if needed first. This target is
valid for SUBROUTINE only. <br><br>
<li>	<b>library. system</b>: Installs the object code in the VICAR system
library. This option may only be used by Configuration Management. The modules
are compiled if needed first. This target is valid for SUBROUTINE only.<br><br>
<li>	<b>clean.obj</b>: Deletes all object code for this unit. Valid for PROGRAM
and SUBROUTINE. <br><br>
<li>	<b>clean.src</b>: Deletes the source code, imakefile, and makefiles. It is
intended mainly for system builds, where the source code can be deleted after
the build because it is maintained in the COMfile. If you are modifying code
and do not have an up-to-date COM file, then do <i>not</i> use the clean.src
target. <br><br>
<li>	<b>doc</b>: Builds all the documentation files for the unit. Currently,
the only supported type of documentation file is a TAE error messagefile,
although other types will be added. Valid for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and
PROCEDURE. <br><br>
<li>	<b>doc.errmsg</b>: Builds the TAE error message file.
</ul><blockquote>Some examples may prove helpful. The first example compiles a
version of the program into the local directory:</blockquote>

<pre>
 make -f prog.make 
</pre>
<blockquote>The
next example is the same, except the documentation (if present) is built as
well: </blockquote>

<pre>
make -f prog.make all 
</pre>
<blockquote>This
example shows building the program for use in the debugger, for systems that
support the "debug" target:</blockquote>

<pre>
make -f prog make debug 
</pre>
<blockquote>The
last example shows how to delete the object modules after a build. This is not
recommended during most program development, because it forces all the modules
to be recompiled every time:</blockquote>

 make -f prog.make clean.obj <a name="_Toc429910623"></a>
