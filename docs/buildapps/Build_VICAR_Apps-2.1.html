2.1 Creating and Using a VICAR Imakefile </H2>
<blockquote>Since vimake is based on the C preprocessor, every line in an
imakefile will be a C preprocessor command. Most lines will be "#define", with
some comments and "#if" statements on occasion. Comments are allowed, in the
standard C style: enclosed by <tt>/* and */</tt>. </blockquote><p>Following is
an example imakefile for the program gen:</p>

<pre>
#define PROGRAM gen <br>#define MODULE_LIST gen. c <br>#define MAIN_LANG_C <br>#define USES_C <br>#define R2LIB <br>#define LIB_RTL <br>#define LIB_TAE
</pre>
<blockquote>The
first two lines define macros with values. PROGRAM specifies that this is an
application program, rather than a subroutine. It also specifies the name of
the application. MODULE_LIST t ells vimake what source code modules make up the
application. <br><br>
The rest of the lines simply define switches; there are no values associated
with them. MAIN_LANG_ C tells vimake that the main program is written in C (or
ANSI C). USES_C says that some (non-ANSI) C is used in the application, because
there is more than one module with mixed languages. R2LIB says that this
application goes in R2LIB. The LIB_RTL and LIB_TAE switches indicate which
libraries to link with, in this case the RTL and TAE libraries. <br><br>
Due to the internals of how vimake operates, there is unfortunately no real
error checking. you have to be sure to spell the macros correctly, or they will
simply be ignored. This may cause surprising results. If vimake is not
operating the way you expect, first check to make sure that all the
preprocessor macros are spelled correctly. <br><br>
vimake can also handle some machine dependencies. All the macros defined in
xvmaininc.h are available for use in #if statements. This is typically used to
compile a VMS-specific module only under VMS, and its UNIX-specific counterpart
only under UNIX.<br><br>
To use an imakefile, simply type the command vimake followed by the name of the
imakefile. imakefiles must have a ".imake" extension, but you should not
extension on the vimake command. The command is the same under both VMS and
UNIX. <tt>vimake gen </tt>If you are running VMS, a file called "gen.bld" will
be created (although it is a DCL COM file, a ".com" extension would confuse it
with the packed application file). This file can be executed to compile and
link the program: <tt>$ @gen.bld </tt>There are many options you can give on
the command line to control the build, which are described in Section <A HREF="Build_VICAR_Apps-2.3.html">2.3</A>
Using the Generated VMS Build File. <br><br>
If you are running UNIX, a file called "gen.make" will be created when you run
vimake. This file can be submitted to <tt>make</tt> to compile and link the
program: <br><br>
There are many different build targets you can give to control the build
process, which are described in Section <A HREF="Build_VICAR_Apps-2.4.html">2.4</A>
Using the Generated UNIX makefile. <br><br>
The imakefile is actually composed of several parts. These parts are described
below, with some examples. Although they can be in any order, the parts should
generally follow the order listed below for consistency. For a complete list of
valid #define's, see the next section. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>Type and name of program unit. </b>The valid types are PROGRAM,
SUBROUTINE, and PROCEDURE. One of these must be defined. The value for the
definition is the name of the program or subroutine. The type of the program
unit determines which of the other vimake features are available. There is
currently not much to be done for a PROCEDURE, but an imakefile must still be
present, for consistency. Documentation may still need to be built for
procedures.</ul>

<pre>
#define PROGRAM logmos <br>#define SUBROUTINE knuth <br>#define PROCEDURE midrarch 
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	<b>List of modules and includes. </b>The names of all source code modules
must be defined ( this does not apply to PROCEDUREs). MODULE_LIST should
contain the names of all the compilable source code, with the appropriate
extension. In UNIX style, FORTRAN modules must end in ".f", <i>not</i> ".for".
The modules are listed in the order they should be linked;
i.e.</ul><blockquote>The main module should be first (this can be overridden by
LINK_LIST). INCLUDE_LIST should contain the names of all include files that are
local to the program or subroutine, i.e. ones that are in the application COM
file and not in p2$inc ($P2INC in UNIX). They should also have the appropriate
filename extension. Both lists are space-separated (not tab-separated) lists of
names. All the names <i>must</i> be in lower case. If you run out of room on a
line, the standard C preprocessor continuation character can be used, which is
a backslash "\" at the end of the line, or use continuation lists. <br><br>
FORTRAN system includes are a special case. They should be listed in the
FTNINC_LIST macro, even though they are not a part of the program unit. See <A HREF="Build_VICAR_Apps-2.2.html#Heading6">2.2.2</A>
Name List Macros, for a description of which includes go in FTNINC_LIST. Local
includes, which are part of the application, go in INCLUDE_LIST instead.
Example:</blockquote>

<pre>
#define MODULE_LIST copy.f<br><br>#define MODULE_LIST logmos.c logmos_subs.c logmos_mosaic.c<br>#define INCLUDE_LIST logmos_defines.h logmos_structures.h \ logmos_globals.h<br><br>#if VMS_OS<br>#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_vms.mar<br>#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_unix.c<br>#else<br>#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_unix.c<br>#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_vms.mar<br>#endif<br><br>#define MODULE_LIST prog.f<br>#define INCLUDE_LIST myinc.fin<br>#define FTNINC_LIST errdefs sublib_inc<br><br>#define MODULE_LIST view.c utils.c image.c vdt.c plot.c \ host.c overlap.c vprofile.c
</pre>
<blockquote>VMS
macro (.mar) and array processor files (.vfc) are allowed by vimake, but are
VMS specific. When MODULE_LIST is defined differently for different machines,
make sure the unused source code is listed in CLEAN_OTHER_LIST so a
clean-source operation can find all the source code to delete. </blockquote><ul>
<li>	<b>Main language. </b>If the application is of type PROGRAM, then the
language the main program is written in must be defined. This is used by the
UNIX version of vimake to determine which command to use to link the program.
The main program is defined as the one that the <tt>main44</tt> subroutine is
written in. The languages that any other modules are written in do not
matter.</ul>

<pre>
#define MAIN_LANG_C <br>#define MAIN_LANG_ FORTRAN 
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Languages used. </b>Define a USES macro for each language used:<ul>
<li>	USES_C for modules are written in Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) C (which
is the case for most VICAR code).<br><br>
<li>	USES_ANSI_C for modules written in ANSI C (USES_C and USES_ANSI_C are
mutually exclusive). <br><br>
<li>	USES_ FORTRAN for modules written in FORTAN. <br><br>
<li>	USES_MACRO (VMS macro:.mar) and USES_VFC (array processor files: .vfc) are
VMS-specific. </ul></ul>

<pre>
#define USES_C <br>#define USES_FORTRAN <br>#if VMS_OS <br>#define USES_MACRO <br>#endif
</pre>
<blockquote>The
vimake system also has the capability to support various kinds of scripts. This
is an extension of the PROCEDURE type, which previously has been used only for
PDF procedures and has not been very useful.<br><br>
In order to deliver a script, define the imake file as a PROCEDURE type, then
list the scripts in MODULE_LIST. Define the appropriate USES_* macro(s) (see
below) and deliver. All other standard vimake rules apply (for instance, you
should define the appropriate library, e.g. R2LIB). The scripts can be packed
either as pdf's (-p) or as source (-s), but source is probably better.<br><br>
For backwards compatibility, a PROCEDURE with no module list is assumed to have
xxx.pdf as its only module (where xxx is the procedure name). This covers most
of the existing procedures, but modules with more than on pdf will eventually
need to be modified to list them all. They will work as-is for now, but when we
move to an install-based system for builds in the future, where we build in one
directory and install the results into another, they won't, so update them as
you can.

<blockquote>The four Unix shells (sh, csh, ksh, bash) are ignored on VMS, i.e.
you could have both .sh and .dcl files in the same MODULE_LIST without having
to do #ifdef's based on the operating system.<br><br>
Note also that while every file requires an extension, many of them are
stripped off on Unix, leaving just the base name. So, xxx.csh becomes just xxx
and yyy.perl becomes just yyy. And DCL .COM files are named .dcl instead of
.com to help avoid confusion with packed .com files (the build will copy them
to a .com extension for runtime use).<br><br>
Below is an example. You would not normally have this many types of things in
the same .com file.</blockquote>

</pre>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Class of program unit. </b>If you are working with a type PROGRAM, then
define either R1LIB, R2LIB, R3LIB, or HWLIB to indicate the class of the
program. If it is a portable SUBROUTINE, then define either P1_SUBLIB,
P2_SUBLIB, P3_SUBLIB, or HW_SUBLIB to indicate the class.</ul><blockquote>For
VMS-specific subroutines, you can define OLD_SUBLIB or OLD_SUBLIB3. (these are
<i>only </i>to allow vimake to be used with the current system. just because a
subroutine has VMS-specific parts does not mean it goes in OLD_SUBLIB, as long
as there are UNIX-specific parts that do the same thing). The program class is
used to select which library a subroutine goes in, to pick up the proper
include directories, and to allow error checking on programs (e. g. a R2LIB
program cannot use R3LIB subroutines), although the error checking is not yet
implemented. </blockquote>

<pre>
#define R2LIB <br>#define P3_SUBLIB
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Documentation files for the module. </b>This applies to all types of
modules, and is the only real use most PROCEDUREs have for the imakefile. Any
documentation that requires building should go in this
section.</ul><blockquote>Currently, the only type implemented is a TAE error
message file (.msg), which is built using the <tt>msgbld</tt> program in TAE.
Error message files are specified using TAE_ERRMSG. Other types of
documentation will be implemented in the future. If no supported documentation
types are supplied with the module, then do not define the documentation
macros.</blockquote>

<pre>
#define TAE_ERRMSG sffac
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Libraries needed for link. </b>This mostly applies to PROGRAMs,
although SUBROUTINE might need it on occasion. Every library you need to link
to should be specified by defining the appropriate LIB macro. This normally
includes LIB_RTL and LIB_TAE for most VICAR programs. The C run-time library is
always included, you need not add it. The order is arbitrary, since they are
only #define's, but you should try to keep them in order of highest-level to
lowest-level, for consistency. For a complete list of all LIB macros currently
defined, see the next section. </ul><blockquote>You may need a library that is
not available via vimake. If so, contact the VICAR system programmer, and the
library will be added. Although some mechanisms have been included to allow you
to set up your own library names for testing, this is <i>highly</i>
discouraged, and is system-dependent. The VICAR system programmer must track
libraries are in use, so they are not omitted when VICAR is ported to a new
system or delivered to an external site. <br><br>
Some libraries have _DEBUG forms, which link the program with the debuggable
version of that library. These are used only during testing. When the program
is ready for delivery, it must not use any debuggable libraries. <br><br>
Some of the LIB macros also set up include directories for the C compiler. In
unusual circumstances, you might need to include a LIB macro in a SUBROUTINE in
order to pick up an include file.</blockquote>

<p>Following
are more examples of VICAR imakefiles. A simple C program, <tt>gen</tt>, was
given above. Below is a simple FORTRAN program:<br>
<tt>#define PROGRAM copy <br>#define MODULE_LIST copy. f <br>#define
MAIN_LANG_FORTRAN <br>#define USES_FORTRAN <br>#define R2LIB <br>#define
LIB_RTL <br>#define LIB_TAE</tt><br>
Following is an example subroutine that uses several different languages and
has VMS-specific code. It illustrates how existing VMS macro code can be
retained for efficiency while using portable C code for other machines.</p>

<pre>
#define SUBROUTINE amosids <br>#if VMS_OS <br>#define MODULE_LIST amosids. fcamosids. c amosufo_vms. mar <br>#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_unix. c <br>#else <br>#define MODULE_LIST amosids. f camosids. c amosufo_unix. c <br>#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_vms. mar <br>#endif <br><br>#define P2_SUBLIB <br>#define USES_C <br><br>#define USES_ FORTRAN <br>#if VMS_OS <br>#define USES_MACRO <br>#endif
</pre>
<p>The
last example is a more complex program, that has many modules, mixed languages,
and uses several subroutine libraries.
