<blockquote>Most UNIX programs come with a "makefile" that is run with the UNIX
command <tt>make</tt> to compile and link the program. The makefile describes
everything needed to build the program, including compiler options, linker
libraries, and location of manual (man) pages. <tt>make</tt> has many
advantages, including compiling only what has changed since the last compile.
<br><br>
The preferred method for the VMS operating system is to have compile and link
statements directly in a <tt>".COM"</tt> file that contains all the application
parts. These are extracted and compiled in one step. The use of an independent
command procedure to build the program under VMS has many advantages. It allows
the application COM file to be separate. It works on all VMS machines, since
DCL is standard. And it is fast, since no subprocesses need to be
created.<br><br>
To build applications under UNIX, it is highly desirable to use <tt>make</tt>
with a makefile. To build under VMS, it is desirable to use DCL with a command
procedure. The makefile and the command procedure are incompatible. Worse yet
there is quite a bit of variation required for makefiles on different UNIX
machines. The commands used often vary, and sometimes there are differences in
the format and capabilities of <tt>make</tt> itself. <br><br>
It would be very cumbersome to require the VICAR application programmer to
maintain two sets of build files for every application (for VMS and UNIX).
Furthermore, the differences in UNIX makefiles would make it almost impossible
to come up with a single makefile for all UNIX systems. A program called imake
has been written to solve these problems. <br><br>
<tt>imake</tt> is used extensively in the X-windows system to build it on many
platforms. TAE uses it as well. <tt>imake</tt> generates makefiles. It uses the
C preprocessor for macros and conditional statements to customize the generated
makefile for a particular platform. The input  <tt>"imakefile" </tt>is a
reduced makefile that contains only the program-specific parts, not the
system-specific parts.<br><br>
A template file provides the system-specific parts of the makefile for each
machine type. The imake program does some minor cleanup on the imakefile, runs
it and the template through the C preprocessor, and does some cleanup on the
output. The result is a makefile that is customized for the system you are on.
<br><br>
This helps to create UNIX makefiles, but what about VMS? If you are familiar
with <tt>imake</tt>, you know that the imakefiles are similar to makefiles.
There is a set of rules and definitions that are set up at the top of the
makefile, but the structure of the imakefile is retained in the makefile. It
would be impossible to generate a VMS command procedure from a typical
imakefile. <br><br>
The VICAR program vimake takes the concept of imake and goes one step further.
Since the compile and link statements for all VICAR programs are quite similar,
they do not need to be specified at all in the imakefile. In fact, vimake
extracts <i>all</i> of the control out of the imakefile, leaving only C
preprocessor commands. <br><br>
The VICAR imakefile contains only a description of <i>what</i> is to be built,
not <i>how</i> to build it. <br><br>
A VICAR imakefile has only C preprocessor statements, mostly <tt>#define</tt>'s
and a few <tt>#if</tt>'s. These #define statements set up the filenames used in
the program, and select various options on how to build the program. The vimake
program uses this information and a system-specific template to create a build
file for any system. Under VMS, it creates a DCL command file that will build
the program. Under UNIX, it creates a makefile instead. The makefile and DCL
command file are never delivered with the program; only the imakefile is.
<br><br>
There are many advantages to this scheme:</blockquote><ul>
<li>	The programmer need only create one imakefile, instead of separate build
files for each system. <br><br>
<li>	It is much easier to create the imakefile than it would be to create a
full-blown build file.<br><br>
<li>	Build files are standardized, since they are created entirely by the
vimake templates, and never modified by the application programmer.<br><br>
<li>	Locations of libraries and other files are standardized, since the
imakefile doesn't specify where the library is, just what library it wants.
<br><br>
<li>	Changing the way applications are built is easy. only the templates need
to change, and all applications will be built the new way.
