3. Application Packer </H1>
<blockquote>A typical VICAR application program, procedure, or SUBLIB
subroutine is composed of several files. These include source code, include
files, PDFs, imakefiles, test files, documentation files, and others. In order
to better manage all these files, they are packed into one file so they can be
treated as a unit. These files are called COM files due to their ".com"
extension. COM files are created and used via a pair of programs called vpack
and vunpack (the "V" is for "VICAR"). <br><br>
vpack and vunpack are complementary, cross-platform programs which are designed
to pack and unpack application COM files. A COM file typically includes source
code, an imakefile, and a PDF file. The COM file may also include test files
and other, application-specific files. Use vunpack to extract files from the
COM file.
