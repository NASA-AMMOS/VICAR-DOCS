Actual Electronic Failure Report submitted by Brian Carcich
------------------------------------------------------------
GLL colleagues,

I have recoded the VICAR program SARGON to remove some limitations and some potential problems. The
following is an FR for that work. The upshot is that the new version should be available as
CUSPIF::SARGON.COM on DECnet and as SARGON.COM via anonymous ftp on moe.tn.cornell.edu
(128.84.242.72). Hopefully this corrected version will be part of the next VICAR release. 

If you don't want to rebuild SARGON.EXE from SARGON.COM, you may just copy SARGON.EXE (and optionally
.PDF) from either of the above sources (don't forget binary for .EXE ftp).

Please note that if you want to build this SARGON, you must also have my updated INSIDE.COM, which I
submitted as an FR last May. INSIDE.COM is available from the same places as SARGON. See notes on
installing SARGON at the end of this note.

Electronic Failure Report
-------------------------

1. Initiated By:	Brian T. Carcich

2. Phone Number:	+01(607)255-5908

3. Mail Address (U.S.postal):	SEE END OF THIS FR

4. Reporting Date (mo/day/yr):	10/14/1991

5. Time of Failure: (Doy/hr/min in local time):	N/A

6. Suspected problem area (H/W, S/W, Procedural, Other):	S/W

7. Projects affected:	GLL SSI

8. Hardware Name (if applicable):	ALL
Property Number:
Location (bldg-rm):

9. Software Name (if applicable):	SARGON
Vicar Version:	ALL
Operating system (ops, cert, dev):	ALL

10. Description of Problem (Describe in as much 
detail as possible so problem can be corrected
without delay. Attach all supporting/explanatory Evidence.):

(1) The graphics Image Memory Plane for VRDI is 
incorrectly hardcoded as 4. This should be obtained
via XDDINFO (or whatever) so it can work with the
X-Window VRDI Device Driver.

(2) There is a limit of 24 vertices to a polygon, in 
part caused by a limited INSIDE.COM. I have
previously submitted an FR for INSIDE which
removes this restriction, and my updated version
of SARGON ups the limit to 298 vertices.

(4) The subroutine OPRATE can easily have an arithmetic 
overflow, and can also ABEND without cleaning up
its VRDI display.

(3) Once you turn debug on, (DBUG), you can't turn it off. 

(5) The data-type of the INSIDE SUBLIB function is 
incorrectly defined as LOGICAL*1 when it should be
LOGICAL*4 or just LOGICAL.


11. System Encountering error:	ALL

12. Real time action to restore capability: 

I have rewritten SARGON.COM to eliminate the above restrictions as well as updating the help file,
&c.
It is available via NSI/DECnet (formerly SPAN) with the command 

$ COPY CUSPIF::SARGON.COM *.*;

It should be accessible via NSI/DECnet to LAW320, GMY059 and TCG059 accounts from MIPL1:: or MIPL3::
as well as selected HIIPS accounts. It is also available for anonymous ftp on the Internet at
moe.tn.cornell.edu (128.84.242.72).

Installation Note: Since you need INSIDE.COM to build this version, you may need to take additional
steps in the build. Here are several possible paths you may take:

(1) Just copy the already-built version of SARGON.EXE (and optionally 
SARGON.PDF). This version should be compatible with VRDI's from "gsmatch=lequal,1,7" forward.

(2) Ignore INSIDE & assume your users will not use more than 24 ver- 
tices per polygon. Copy SARGON.COM and @SARGON. CAVEAT EMPTOR! 

(3) Ignore INSIDE improvements and physically limit SARGON to 
24 vertices per polygon. To do this, edit all occurences in SARGON.COM of the line

PARAMETER MNVERT = 300

to read

PARAMETER MNVERT = 26

and then DO "$ @SARGON".

(4) Get and build INSIDE and put it in your regular SUBLIB: 

$ @INSIDE SORC
$ FORTRAN INSIDE
$ LIBR/LOG/REPL R2LIB:SUBLIB INSIDE
$ @SARGON
This, however, gives a non-official VICAR R2LIB:SUBLIB.OLB. 

(5) Build and use SARGON.OLB:

$ @SARGON SORC
$ FORTRAN SARGON
$ @SARGON OLB
$ @INSIDE SORC
$ FORTRAN INSIDE
$ LIBR/LOG/REPL SARGON INSIDE
$ @SARGON LINK

(6) Put the INSIDE subroutine into a local object library: 

$ DEFINE CU_SUBLIB disk:[culib]CU_SUBLIB	!* ** see below
$ CREATE CU_SUBLIB
CU_SUBLIB/LIB
R2LIB:SUBLIB/LIB
^Z
$ RENAME/LOG CU_SUBLIB .OPT
$ @INSIDE SORC
$ FORTRAN INSIDE
$ LIBR/CREAT/LOG CU_SUBLIB INSIDE
$ @SARGON

* "disk:[culib]" is a location you pick for this local object 
library.

** If you can make this a DEFINE/SYSTEM and make it permanent 
(i.e. put it somewhere in the system startup files), so much the better.
