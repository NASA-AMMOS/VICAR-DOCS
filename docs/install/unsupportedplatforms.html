<H1><b>6.6</b> <a name="Unsupport">Unsupported Platforms</a></H1>

<P>The following machines exist at MIPL, and should work, but have not been officially tested.</P>
<UL><LI>	Hewlett-Packard 9000 series 700 HPUX 9.0
<LI>	PC running Solaris 2.1</UL>
In addition, the following machines have worked in the past, but they have not been tested in quite some time, and there are likely to be some problems (There may be an older version of TAE available (pre 5.2), but we at MIPL don't supply it):
<UL><LI>	DECstations running Ultrix
<LI>	Macintosh running A/UX
<LI>	Alliant FX series
<LI>	Sun 3</UL>
<P>The following machines have a partial port, but the software will not work without some modifications (the Cray would be very difficult to support, due to major differences in pixel sizes and data types):</P>
<UL><LI>	Tektronix workstation
<LI>	Cray supercomputer</UL>
<P>Finally, one non-UNIX operating system is available (other than VAX/VMS). Most of the software works, but not all. If you wish to use this machine type, contact the VICAR system programmer at MIPL for further information.</P>
<UL><LI>	Macintosh native mode (not A/UX) w/Macintosh Programmers Workbench
(MPW)</UL>

VICAR may be ported to other machines in the future, or
you may do your own port. If you wish to do your own port, please refer to
the <a href="//www-mpl.jpl.nasa.gov//~dnj/GllDemo/Intro/MIPSContacts.html"">contact list</a> for information.
