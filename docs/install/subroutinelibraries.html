<H1><b>6.2</b> <a name="SubLibes">Subroutine Libraries</a></H1>

<P>Some of the VICAR applications link to libraries which you may not have at
your site. The library may be proprietary to a vendor (so it doesn't get
distributed with VICAR), or it may be simply something you don't need (like our
Real-Time telemetry system).

<P> These special libraries are listed below. The abbreviations are used for the
link groups, which are described later. You should go through the list and
decide which libraries you have, and which you don't. (There are several other
link groups that are currently empty that are present for compatibility with
VMS.)</P>

<UL>

<LI>nimscal: This is a library supplied by the NIMS (Galileo) team that performs
radiance and wavelength calibration, band-dependent scaling of radiances to
halfword, and boom correction. It is currently used only by the program NIMSCMM.

<LI>pics: PICS is an image processing system developed by the USGS in Flagstaff,
Arizona. The library is currently only used by the program PIC2VIC to read a
PICS-formatted image file.

<LI>spice: SPICE is a library provided by the Navigation Ancillary Information
Facility (NAIF) group at JPL that provides access to SPICE data files, which
contain image geometry information. If you have the SPICE library, the
lenvironment variable $SPICELIB must point to the directory containing the
library in order to link the programs that use it. Note that MIPL has modified
the SPICE library somewhat, and there are some other logical names and files you
need to use SPICE that you may need to change in VICSET1.COM. We include SPICE
in the external directory as part of our delivery.

<LI>pds_label: The Planetary Data System (PDS) Label Library is an evolving set
of routines written in C which can be used to read, process, and write PDS
labels. The Label Library reads and writes labels in the Object Description
Language (ODL). The Label Library may be linked with any program which must deal
with PDS labels. It was developed in order to encourage others to use PDS
labels, to make it easier to mass produce PDS labels, and to provide a method
for enforcing ODL standards. It has been tested on the Sun and on VAX/VMS.

</UL>

<P>Any program that uses one of these libraries will not link at your site if
the library doesn't exist. The VICAR build procedures account for this by
allowing you to omit programs that link to libraries you don't have. The
mechanism for doing this is called a <I>link group</I>.</P>

<P> Every program belongs to one and only one link group. If a program used the
SPICE library, it would be in the SPICE link group. Due to a peculiarity in CMS
(which maintains these groups for us), programs which would fall into more than
one group get their own group which is a combination of the two. So, DTR
contains only programs that link to Datatrieve, DTR_SPICE contains programs that
link to both DTR and SPICE, etc.</P>

<P>The current link groups are (note that many of these groups are currently not
used):</P>

<UL>
<LI>DTR
<LI>DTR_FPS
<LI>DTR_RT_SHR
<LI>DTR_SHR_IMG
<LI>DTR_SPICE
<LI>EASY (applications with no special libraries)
<LI>FPS
<LI>FPS_RT_SHR
<LI>FPS_SPICE
<LI>IDM_SHR
<LI>NIMSCAL_SPICE (p2 only)
<LI>PDS_LABEL (p2prog only)
<LI>PICS (p2 only)
<LI>RDM
<LI>RT_SHR_IMG
<LI>SPICE
<LI>SYBASE (p2prog only)
</UL>

<P>A typical external site may use only the EASY group, or more likely
EASY, FPS, RDM_SHR_IMG, and RDM.</P>

<P>To find out which programs are in a link group, simply look at the file
imake_obj.p2prog in $P2TOP, or imake_obj.p3prog in $P3TOP. All programs
belonging to the group will be listed in that file. It would be a good idea to
scan through the programs in the link groups you aren't using to see if any of
the programs are needed at your site. If they are, you should look into getting
the appropriate library.</P>

<P>The list of groups you want to build is used as an argument to the application
build procedure. Take note of which groups you want; it'll be needed later.</P>
