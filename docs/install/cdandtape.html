<H3>CD
Information
</H3>
MIPS may distribute either standard CD-ROM (read only media) or CD-WO (write-once). Both CD's work
identically in your CD reader. CD-ROM are duplicated through a commercial provider who mass-produces
them on pressing machines. CD-WO are made one at a time in a special machine. MIPS has three of these
CD writing machines. CD-WO blank media costs ~$10 each (4/10/96), so they should not be, like
ordinary CD-ROMs, used as Frisbees.

<A name="RTFToC54">8mm
(Exabyte) Tape Drives
</A></H4>
An 8mm tape cartridge (taken out of the plastic storage box) is about 3 3/4" x 2 1/2" x 5/8". It is
important to tell us what model of tape drive you use, so we can send you the proper tape format. As
far as we are aware, all 8mm digital tape drives are made by 
<A href="http://www.Exabyte.COM">Exabyte</A>.
8mm tapes can be written in a variety of  <A
href="http://www.Exabyte.COM/TechnicalSupport/ProductSupport/answers/in0033.html">density/compression</A>
combinations. Each Exabyte 8mm tape drive can read a sub-set of these combinations. If you don't know
the model number of your drive, you can identify it by the front panel's appearance. See <A
href="http://www.Exabyte.COM/TechnicalSupport/ProductSupport/answers/in0059.html">Drawings of the
front panels</A>. For reference note the: <A href="http://www.sresearch.com/search/105167.htm">list
of 8mm drive vendors</A>.
<H4>
4mm
DAT (Digital Audio Tape) Drives
</H4>
<P>
A 4mm tape cartridge (taken out of the plastic storage box) is about 2 7/8" x 2 1/8" x 7/16". We
distribute 4mm DAT tapes in 60M length, no compression. This format is compatible with all 4mm DAT
tape drives, and gives a maximum of 1.3 Mb.  For reference note the: <A <a
