<H1><b>7.2</b> <a name="OtherSoftReq">Other Software Requirements</a></H1>

<P>In addition to TAE, some other software is required to run and/or build VICAR. These are listed
below. Most of the time this software will be provided along with your operating system.
</P>
<H3>
Shell</H3>

<P>At the present time, the VICAR build and setup
procedures are written only for the C-shell (csh). A csh-compatible shell,
such as the Tenex C-shell, tcsh (T-shell), available from <A
href=ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/>UUnet comp.sources</A> by anonymous ftp, 
will also work. </P>

<H3>
Compilers</H3>

<P>In order to build the system parts of VICAR, you must
have a C compiler. In addition, many applications require a FORTRAN
compiler, so realistically you need both. Note that the compilers are only
required to rebuild VICAR (or to develop new software);
you don't need them if you do not need to rebuild.</P>

<P>The C compiler for all machines ported to so far is the standard C
compiler that comes with the computer. ANSI C is required for some
applications, and will be used more in the future. None of the system
libraries currently require ANSI C. If you have a choice, get a C compiler
that handles ANSI in addition to the standard Kernighan &amp; Ritchie
C.</P>

<P>The FORTRAN compiler must support the FORTRAN 77 standard. In addition,
several extensions must be supported. These are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>	Data types BYTE and INTEGER*2 (Not LOGICAL*1).
<LI>	Data type length specifiers (i.e. the *2 in INTEGER*2).
<LI>	DO-WHILE loops.
<LI>	DO-END DO loops.
<LI>	IMPLICIT NONE.
<LI>	INCLUDE statement.
<LI>Symbolic names up to 31 characters, with at least 14 characters significant in external
subroutine names. Names must allow lowercase letters (not case sensitive) and the underscore
character (_).

<LI> The exclamation point (!) must start a comment anywhere in the source
line. 

<LI> Tab-format source lines (source lines may start with a TAB
character)</UL> For the Macintosh running A/UX version 3.0, the standard
FORTRAN 77 compiler is not acceptable. You may want to try the <A

href="http://www.absoft.com">http://www.absoft.com</a>.<P>We use
vendor-supplied C++ on all platforms. 

<H3>
X-Windows</H3>

<P>At the present time, the X window system is not technically required to
run VICAR. However, X-windows currently provides the only
display capability under UNIX, since the UNIX VRDI only supports
X-windows.</P>

<P>The SAGE (Science Analysis Graphical Environment) VICAR graphical user interface (GUI), presently under
development, is X-windows/Motif based.</P>

<P>X-windows <I>is</I> required if you intend to build the VRDI.</P>

<H3>
Motif</H3>

<P>TAE+ 5.2 uses Motif. While TAE can be relinked without Motif support,
installation will be much easier if it is available. </P>

<H3>
Imake</H3>

<P>All VICAR build procedures require that the "imake"
program be in the program search path ($PATH). This program is supplied
standard on some machines. For others, it may be obtained either from the
X-windows distribution (which is where it was developed), or from the TAE
tree. Make sure that the program is available in the search path by typing
"which imake" at a shell prompt. </P>

<H3>
Disk Space
</H3>

<P>VICAR currently requires over 300 MB of disk space to
build for a single platform type. Much of this space (83 MB) is for TAE+.
The rest is for other parts of VICAR, including some
padding. If you build VICAR for more than one type of 
platform, significantly more disk space will be required.</P>
