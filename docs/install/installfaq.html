<LI>The VICAR system was linked with Solaris 2.4. I have 
Solaris 2.5, and it doesn't work.
<P>Copy the proper dynamic libraries from a Solaris 2.4 system. See <a href="solaris25notes.html">Notes on using Solaris 2.5</a>.</P>

<LI>How do I tell which dynamic (shareable) libraries I need to run a 
VICAR program?
<P>See <a href="dynamicunixdepend.html">Finding UNIX Programs' Dynamic  Dependencies</a> and <a href="dynamicvmsdepend.html">Finding Programs' Dependence on OpenVMS Shareable  Libraries</a>.</P>

<LI>I get the following error on OpenVMS:
<BR><KBD>Error activating image 
MULTINET_SOCKET_LIBRARY<BR>
Image file [SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][MULTINET]MULTINET_SOCKET_LIBRARY.EXE<BR>
Ident mismatch with shareable image</KBD>.<BR>

<P>You have to use the same (or higher number) Multinet version as the one 
that the executable was linked with. See <a href="dynamicvmsdepend.html">Finding Programs' Dependence on OpenVMS Shareable  Libraries</a>. MULTINET_SOCKET_LIBRARY 
is a logical name for the shareable socket library. Also see <a href="beforeinstalling.html#OpenVMSreq">OpenVMS DEC-Alpha Requirements</a>.</P>

<LI>I'm having problems rebuilding VICAR programs on my
system. I don't seem to have the right libraries. Is there any way I can 
get my programs rebuilt without having to pay for 3rd-party software?

<P>You can rebuild programs at MIPS, or we can do it for you. See 
<a href="rebuildingorrecompiling.html#BuildAlts">Alternatives to Rebuilding On Your  System</a>.</P>

<LI>I want to build a version of GALSOS on my Alpha Open VMS systems that 
doesn't need the Multinet 3rd-party software. How can I do this at my site?

<P>Edit <KBD>[VICAR.RTL.INC]xvmaininc.h</KBD> to set 
<KBD>SYBASE_AVAIL_OS</KBD> to <KBD>0</KBD>. See <a href="rebuildingorrecompiling.html#NoSocket">Rebuilding Without Socket (Network)  Support</a>.</P>
