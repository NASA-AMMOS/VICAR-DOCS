<H1><b>4.3</b> <a name="Solaris25">Notes on using Solaris 2.5</a></H1>

<P>The current distributed version of VICAR is compiled
and linked on Solaris 2.4, and we only guarantee it on that platform. Any
incompatibility with 2.5 is Sun's fault. You'd think they'd want to ship
an incremental upgrade that would work with executables linked with the
previous version!</P>

<P>However, we have installed VICAR on a couple Solaris
2.5 systems. It works fine, once you copy the libF77.so.2 and libXm.so.3
libraries (exact, and I do mean exact file names) from a Solaris 2.4
system, if you don't have them already.</P>

<P>After you copy these libraries over, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental 
variable has to point to the directory they're in, if you don't or can't 
put them in the default /usr/lib/ (or for libF77.so.2) /usr/lang/lib/ 
directories.</P>

<P>If any smart-aleck asks you why we didn't link VICAR
statically to avoid these library problems, tell her/him that this would
almost double the size of VICAR.</P>

<P>You can copy the 2.4 libraries to your 2.5 system's /usr/lib without 
any conflicts, since Sun changes the filenames. Another way would be to 
create a new directory, say /usr/lib/2.4/ or the like, and copy all the 
lib* files to it. Then add that directory to the end of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
Those lib* may be in a number of different directories, though, like: 
/usr/openwin/lib, /usr/4lib/ or /usr/dt/lib, so don't stop at /usr/lib.</P>

<P>If you wondering why you can't fool Solaris 2.5 with symbolic 
links to other library versions, see below:</P>
