<H1><b>6.4</b> <a name="VersionNo">The VICAR Version Number</a></H1>

<P>The VICAR version numbers are presented to the user each time he/she enters
the VICAR system. The version number consists of several parts. For example,
this document applies to VICAR versions starting at system release 12.1 and
executive version 5B/16B.</P>

<P>The system release number represents a version of the entire VICAR system, as
it was released at a given time. It changes purely as a result of release date,
as a result of MIPL internal deliveries, and provides no information in and of
itself regarding changes to the system. It is, however, the easiest number to
use to tell someone at MIPL which version of VICAR you are using.</P>

<P>The VICAR executive version number describes the actual state of the
executive software. The first part of the executive version number, in our
example 5B, represents the version of TAE in use, as applied to VICAR. Each time
MIPL receives a new version of TAE, the number (here, 5) is incremented. A two
represents TAE 1.3B, a three is TAE 1.4, four is TAE 4.1, and a five is TAE 5.2.
The fact that our version 5 is TAE's version 5 is just coincidence. The letter
represents changes made at MIPL to the indicated version of TAE. Thus, version
5B is the second VICAR release of TAE 5.2. Version 5C will be the next increment
of VICAR modifications.</P>

<P>The second part of the executive version number, in our example 16B,
represents the version of the VICAR Run-Time Library in use. Each time a major
change is made to the RTL, the number is incremented, and the letter is reset to
A. Version 15A was the first release of the UNIX-compatible RTL, which is
definitely a major change! Version 15C is the third version of the
UNIX-compatible RTL. Version 16 started when the system was available on
Solaris. The letter gets incremented for minor enhancements and bug fixes.</P>
