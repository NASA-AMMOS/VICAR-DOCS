This was accomplished by the creation         of a new VICAR-based file format for tabulating raster format geographic         information over multiple data planes. </font> </div>      <p align="justify">       <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The         IBIS tabular file format, together with its associated IBISFIL subroutine         library and programs, forms the heart of the IBIS system and has proved         to be very useful tool for many diverse applications, such as multispectral         classification, image rubbersheeting and mosaicing, stereo matching, image         indexing and other geographic/cartographic applications.</font>      <p align="justify">       <P align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The         primary purpose of image files is the storage of visual information. Images         are two (or sometimes three) dimensional arrays of data, with no fundamental         difference between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the file,         which are generally geometric. The fact that two elements (pixels) share         a common coordinate value means little, since the coordinate axes are         arbitrary. The data within an image file is homogeneous -- that is, all         of the elements of the array are of the same type, format, and have the         same units (if any). The nomenclature of images refers to the vertical         coordinate as the "line", and the horizontal coordinate as the "sample",         drawing from the operation of digital image sensors operating on a scanline         basis, with the individual pixels being successive samplings of the sensor         within a scanline. </font>      <p align="justify">       <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Both         tabular and graphics formats may also be thought of as two-dimension arrays         of data of varying data types, but there are some dramatic differences         as well. </font>      <p align="justify">       <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Tabular         files have a much broader scope than images and are used in tabulating         statistics, indexing, geographic information systems, tiepoint generation         for image mosaics, color lookup tables (VIDS), multispectral classification,         and as serving as a general-purpose spreadsheeting utility. Tabular files,         therefore, require a more complex structure than image files. In the IBIS         system the vertical columns of data must consist of homogeneously formatted         data, and the horizontal rows may contain heterogeneous data records of         varying types. The elements having the same row coordinates are strongly         related to one another, and are often used as a tabulated set of attributes         or statistics for a class or sampling. The elements of a column are related         in that they all represent the same type of measurement of an attribute,         all have the same format and data type. Neither row nor column coordinates         may have much to do with geometry, and sometimes the order within a row         or column may be entirely arbitrary. </font>      <p align="justify">       <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Graphics         files are generally used to describe polygonal regions, and consist of         a list of coordinate vectors of the successive vertices of the polygons.         In fact, graphics may be considered in a subclass of tabular, in that         it consists solely of numerical values, while tabular may also contain         text. In the tabular model, then, each row is associated with a single         vertex, and the row order in a column determines the sequence of plotting         the vertices. The only special values in a graphics file are when the         coordinates are all zero, which indicates a "pen-up" command, rather than         a geometric position.</font>      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> More         information regarding using the system may be obtained by accessing the         <A HREF=/ibis/i2pg.html>IBIS-2 Programmers         Guide</A>. </font></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><div align="center">        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A HREF="/index.php"><strong>HOME</strong></A></font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Webmaster:Shari           Mayer<br>          Last update: April 2, 2003</font></p>        </div></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
