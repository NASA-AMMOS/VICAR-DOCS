In this section, the user is introduced to some of the fundamental
concepts of the VICAR image processing system.  The new user will
learn how to enter and exit VICAR and be introduced to VICAR datasets,
labels and "procs".  An understanding of these concepts is essential
to effectively use VICAR and is assumed in subsequent sections. <P>

<A NAME="4.1">
<H2>4.1	Entering/Exiting VICAR</H2>
</A>

A VICAR session starts when a user invokes the VICAR executive by
typing the command <CODE>vicar</CODE> at the prompt (% or $). <P>

The user is then prompted for a VICAR command (<A
HREF="vug7.html#7.1">Section 7.1</A>) with a VICAR prompt,
<STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>. <P>

The session ends when a user exits VICAR by typing the command
<CODE>exit</CODE> at the VICAR prompt. <P>

<A NAME="4.3">
<H2>4.3	VICAR Datasets</H2>
</A>

A VICAR dataset is a file with fixed length records (<A
HREF="#4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</A>).  This dataset can be categorized as
image data, which is a digital representation of a visual "picture",
or as non-image data.  The dataset structure for both types of data is
the same, thus simplifying the VICAR interface. <P>

<A NAME="4.3.1">
<H3>4.3.1 Dataset Names</H3>
</A>

The VICAR user should name disk datasets with care. <P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <EM>Unlike the VAX/VMS operating system, the
UNIX operating system is case sensitive.  While VICAR commands are not
case sensitive, the filenames still are.  Therefore,
<CODE>planet.img</CODE> and <CODE>PLANET.IMG</CODE> are two different
files on a UNIX system.</EM><P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG>
<EM>VICAR users should avoid using system assigned logical names (on
VMS systems) or environment variables and aliases (on UNIX systems)
for dataset names.  Assigned logical names can be obtained by typing
the <CODE>SHOW LOGICAL</CODE> command in DCL, </EM><P>

<EM>Syntax:</EM><P>

    <STRONG>%</STRONG> alias
</PRE>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <EM>When VICAR is required to write an output
dataset, the VICAR executive I/O routines will check the directory for
an existing dataset of the same name.  If one exists, it will write
the new dataset directly over the old dataset instead of creating a
new version.  For example, if a dataset named <CODE>over.byt</CODE>
was created at 10:15, and another image with the same name was created
at 10:18, there would be only a single entry in the current directory:
</EM><P>

UNIX:

    -rw-r--r--  1 edd         10400 Aug  5 10:18 over.byt

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG>
<EM>On VMS systems, when a file is overwritten, the space allocation is
updated, but the creation date is not. On UNIX systems, both are
updated.</EM><P>

<A NAME="4.3.1.1">
<H4>4.3.1.1 Temporary Datasets</H4>
</A>

Temporary files are special files that are deleted when a user logs
off.  Under the old VMS VICAR, temporary files were specified by
leaving off the filename extensions and assigning instead a
<CODE>.Z<VAR>xx</VAR></CODE> extension, where
<CODE><VAR>xx</VAR></CODE> was based on the process ID.  While that
approach still works under VMS, files that begin with a plus sign
(<CODE>+</CODE>) will now be recognized as temporary files on both
UNIX and VMS systems.  <P>

Under the old system, temporary files were distinguised only by their
name, and could be generated anywhere.  The new style is to collect
them all in one directory.  Prepending a plus sign (+) to the name
tells the VICAR RTL to put the files in the temporary directory.  This
directory is pointed at by the <CODE>$VTMP</CODE> environment variable
in UNIX, and the <CODE>VTMP:</CODE> rooted logical name in VMS.
<CODE>VTMP</CODE> is set up by <CODE>vicset2</CODE> for both systems.
(It normally points at <CODE>/tmp/<VAR>username</VAR></CODE> for UNIX
and a scratch directory for VMS).  On VMS machines, because
<CODE>VTMP:</CODE> is a rooted directory, accessing the directory
outside of VICAR is a little awkward; you must use
<CODE>vtmp:[000000]</CODE>.  <P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <EM>The automatic deletion of the
<CODE>/tmp/<VAR>username</VAR></CODE> directory contents has not yet
been established in UNIX VICAR.  Therefore, in order to delete those
files when you exit VICAR, you will need to place a <CODE>ush /bin/rm
/tmp/<VAR>username</VAR>/*</CODE> command in your
<CODE>ulogoff.pdf</CODE>.  (See <A HREF="vug5.html#5.4.2">Section
5.4.2</A> for details on how to do this.)</EM> <P>

Subdirectories of <CODE>VTMP</CODE> are permitted.  Under UNIX, they
are referenced by <CODE>+sub_dir/file</CODE>, while under VMS, they
are referenced by <CODE>+[sub_dir]file</CODE>.  The subdirectories are
not automatically created; they must be created in advance using
<CODE>mkdir $VTMP/sub_dir</CODE> under UNIX and <CODE>cre/dir
vtmp:[sub_dir]</CODE> under VMS.  Because of these differences, the
use of subdirectories is not portable between systems.  <P>

Currently, all processes using the same login id share the same
temporary directory.  This may be changed in the future so concurrent
independent jobs will have separate directories.  In the meantime, a
workaround can be used, which is to redefine <CODE>VTMP</CODE> to use
a process-specific directory name. <P>


<A NAME="4.3.2">
<H3>4.3.2 Dataset Structure</H3>
</A>

A standard structure has been established for VICAR datasets and all
VICAR programs operate with this structure by calling standard
interface subroutines.  (See the <CITE>VICAR Run-time Library
Reference Manual</CITE> and <A
HREF="/vicar/vic_file_fmt.html"><CITE>The VICAR
File Format</CITE></A>.) <P>

A VICAR dataset is a file of fixed-length records consisting of five
parts: <P>

<UL>
<LI>VICAR label (primary label)
<LI>binary label header - optional
<LI>binary label prefix - optional
<LI>pixel data
<LI>end-of-dataset label (EOL) - optional
</UL>
<P>

Although the exact structure of a VICAR dataset varies depending on
the presence of the three optional parts (binary label header, binary
label prefix, and EOL), all VICAR datasets follow the same structure. <P>

The VICAR label is an ASCII string containing information describing
the size, origin, processing history and attributes of the dataset. <P>

The binary label header and prefix are optional areas for storing
information about a dataset in free form binary format. <P>

The pixel data portion of the dataset is made up of samples (pixels)
of specified data format (<A HREF="#4.3.3">Section 4.3.3</A>).  The
data dimensions are described in terms of "number of samples" (NS -
record length), "number of lines" (NL - number of records of length
NS), and "number of bands" (NB - number of NL x NS data planes). <P>

The end-of-dataset label is an optional area for continuation of the
VICAR label. <P>

For a more comprehensive discussion of dataset structure, refer to
<A HREF="vug9.html#9.1">Section 9.1</A>. <P>

<A NAME="4.3.3">
<H3>4.3.3 Pixel Data Formats</H3>
</A>

Each sample of a dataset contains the same number of bytes, as defined
by the <CODE>FORMAT</CODE> item in the VICAR label (<A
HREF="vug9.html#9.2">Section 9.2</A>).  The allowed values for
<CODE>FORMAT</CODE> and the characteristics of these pixel format
types are defined in the following table. <P>

<A NAME="Table 4.3.3">
<PRE>
			<STRONG>Table 4.3.3</STRONG></A> <P>

	        Bytes    Bits
    Format 	 per 	 per	     	Description
	        Sample 	Sample

    BYTE	  1	   8	    unsigned, binary integer
			            (data range:  0 to 255)
    HALF	  2	  16	    signed, binary integer 
			            (data range:  -32,768 
			            to +32,767)
    FULL	  4	  32	    signed, binary integer
    REAL	  4	  32	    floating point
    COMP	  8	  64	    a pair of REAL values	
    DOUB	  8	  64	    double precision floating 
			            point
</PRE></A><P>

Note: There may still be a few programs which use the old convention
of <CODE>WORD</CODE> instead of <CODE>HALF</CODE>, and
<CODE>COMPLEX</CODE> instead of <CODE>COMP</CODE>.  VICAR will
continue to support these programs until they are converted to use the
proper formats. <P>

<A NAME="4.4">
<H2>4.4	VICAR Labels</H2>
</A>

A VICAR label contains dynamic information that describes the size,
origin, processing history and attributes of the associated dataset.
All VICAR application programs are designed to read information from
the VICAR labels of the input datasets and dynamically update
them. <P>

All VICAR datasets must be in "VICAR format" which means they are
required to have a standard VICAR label in order to be processed.
Data received from other facilities with "foreign" (non-VICAR) formats
require a special purpose program, called a "logging" program, to read
and convert the data into VICAR format (<A
HREF="vug8.html#8.3.3">Section 8.3.3</A>). <P>

<A NAME="4.4.1">
<H3>4.4.1 VICAR Label Structure</H3>
</A>

A VICAR label is an ASCII string composed of label items which are
<VAR>keyword</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR> pairs separated by spaces. <P>

<EM>Syntax:</EM><P>

<PRE>
    <VAR>keyword</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR>

	where:	 <VAR>keyword</VAR>   is a text keyword that identifies 
			    the label item

		 <VAR>value</VAR>	   is the information portion of the 
			    label item; may be of type string, 
			    integer, real, or double, and may be 
			    multi-valued
</PRE>

<EM>Examples:</EM>   Possible <VAR>keyword</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR> pairs.

<DL>
<DT>NL=800
<DT>FORMAT='HALF'
<DT>SIZE=(1,1,800,800)
</DL>

A VICAR label contains 3
 different classes of
<VAR>keyword</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR> label items: <P>

<UL>
<LI>system
<LI>property
<LI>history
</UL>

The system portion consists of those items that are independent of the
history of the dataset.  These items include:   size of the image, its
organization, its pixel format, host type and items indicating the
existence of the optional sections of the dataset. <P>

The property portion of the label contains items that describe
properties of the image in the image domain, such as the map
projection, lookup table, and latitude/longitude information. <P>

The history label portion consists of information relating to the
processing history of the data.  Each time a program processes a
dataset, VICAR adds history items to the label.  The history items
include:   processing task name, user's identification, processing
date and time.  Thus, a sequence of  subsets are recorded
chronologically in the dataset label. <P>

For a detailed description of the VICAR label structure, refer to <A
HREF="vug9.html#9.2">Section 9.2</A>.  For examples explaining how to
list labels, see <A HREF="vug10.11-12.html#10.12">Appendix
10.12</A>. <P>

<A NAME="4.5">
<H2>4.5	Procs</H2>
</A>

When commanding VICAR, the user either issues intrinsic commands or
invokes procedures or processes.  Intrinsic commands are predefined
operations used to manage a session. A procedure is a collection of
VICAR commands that may be executed as one function.  A process is a
program which gets activated by VICAR. <P>

Procedures and processes are collectively referred to as "procs"
because they are identical in invocation syntax.  Therefore,
throughout this document "proc" will be used whenever it is not
necessary to distinguish between procedures and processes <A
HREF="vug7.html#7.3">(Section 7.3)</A>. <P>
