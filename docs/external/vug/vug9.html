<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> This section expands on two basic concepts
introduced in Section 4: datasets and labels.  More detailed
information on dataset and label structure can be found in <A
HREF="/vicar/vic_file_fmt.html"><CITE>The VICAR
File Format</CITE></A>. <P>

<A NAME="9.1">
<H2>9.1	Dataset Structure</H2>
</A>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The standard structure for VICAR datasets is a
file of fixed-length records which consists of the parts listed
below.  Figure 9.1 is a visual representation of the dataset
structure. <P>

<UL>
<LI>VICAR label (<A HREF="#9.2">Section 9.2</A>)
<LI>binary label header - optional
<LI>binary label prefix - optional
<LI>pixel data
<LI>end-of-dataset label (EOL; <A
HREF="vug4.html#4.4">Section 4.4</A>) - optional 
</UL>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The binary label is an optional area for
storing information about a dataset in free-form binary format.  The
data in the binary label are not defined by the executive, but by the
individual applications.  There are two parts to the binary label, the
binary header and the binary prefix. The binary header is useful for
storing information which may pertain to the entire dataset.  The
binary prefix consists of a fixed number of bytes from each pixel data
line and is useful for storing line-dependent information (e.g.,
marking "bad" data).  The binary label is hidden from programs unless
they specifically request access to it.  If a program does request
access, the binary label is then treated as a part of the data.  If
access is not requested, the binary label will not be present in the
output dataset. <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The pixel data portion of a dataset may
contain between 1 and 2.147E9 (2 to the power of 31, minus 1) lines,
each of the same length.  The maximum length is dependent upon the
storage device.  Each line is a sequence of pixels whose format is
represented by 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes (<A HREF="vug4.html#Table
4.3.3">Table 4.3.3</A>) and is fixed for a given dataset.  In the
"picture" interpretation, each line of a dataset represents one raster
scan line. The sequence of lines represents the sequence of raster
scan lines beginning with line 1 and proceeding down.
Multi-dimensional pixel data can be organized in one of three ways:
band-sequential (BSQ), band-interleaved by line (BIL) or
band-interleaved by pixel (BIP).  Additional information on
multi-dimensional pixel data organization can be found in the
<CITE>VICAR Run-time Library Reference Manual</CITE>. <P>

<A NAME="9.2">
<H2>9.2	VICAR Label Structure</H2>
</A>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The VICAR label is an ASCII string containing
free-field items of the form <CODE>keyword=value</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug4.html#4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</A>) separated by spaces.  <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The VICAR label contains three classes of
information.  Dataset description ("system") items describe the size,
organization, data format, and existence of the optional sections of
the dataset. "Property" items describe properties of the image in the
image domain, such as the map projection, lookup table, and
latitude/longitude information.  "History" items describe the history
of the pixel data in the dataset, the procs that have processed the
pixel data, sometimes their parameters, the user identification, and
the processing date and time. <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> System items in the VICAR label include, in
order:

<PRE>
LBLSIZE		the size of the label in bytes
FORMAT		the data format of the pixels in the image
		(byte, half, full, real, doub, or comp; word
		long, and complex may also be found but are
		obsolete)
TYPE		the dataset type (image, param, graph1, graph2
		graph3, tabular)
BUFSIZ		(obsolete, but still required; set it equal to
		RECSIZE in new files) the internal blocksize 
		VICAR will use during I/O
DIM		the number of dimensions in the file (always
		equals 3)
EOL		end-of-dataset label (if there is an EOL, EOL=1)
RECSIZE		the size in bytes of each record in the VICAR
		file
ORG		data organization:
		BSQ	band sequential
		BIL 	band interleaved by line 
		BIP	band interleaved by pixel
NL		number of lines (number of records)
NS		number of samples (record length)
NB		number of image bands (number of data planes)
N1		equal to NS or NB depending on pixel data 
		organization (ORG - Table 9.2) 
N2		equal to NL, NS or NB depending on pixel data 
		organization (ORG - Table 9.2) 
N3		equal to NB or NL depending on pixel data 
		organization (ORG - Table 9.2) 
N4		not yet used; defaults to 0
NBB		number of binary prefix bytes
NLB		number of binary header records
HOST		the type of computer used to generate the
		image (alliant, cray, decstatn, hp-700,
		mac-aux, mac-mpw, sgi, sun-3, sun-4, tek,
		vax-vms)
INTFMT		format used ot represent integer pixels
		(byte, half, and full) in the file. (low, for 
		vax-vms and decstatn; high for all other
		except cray, which isn't implemented yet)
REALFMT		format used to represent floating-point
		pixels (real, doub, and comp) in the file.
		(rieee for decstatn; vax for vax-vms; ieee
		for all others except cray which isn't
		implemented yet)
BHOST		type of computer used to generate the
		binary label. (same values as HOST)
BINTFMT		format used to represent integers in the
		binary label (same values as INTFMT)
BREALFMT	format used to represent floating-point
		data in the binary label (same values as
		REALFMT)
BLTYPE		type of binary label

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> Property labels are located between the system
and the history labels.  They begin with the first occurrence of the
keyword <CODE>PROPERTY</CODE> and end with the first occurrence of the
keyword <CODE>TASK</CODE>.  A dataset may exclude property labels
entirely.  Each property begins with a <CODE>PROPERTY</CODE> keyword,
which is the name of the property set. This is followed by the label
items that make up the property. The valid property names, and the
keywords that make up each property, are defined in a name registry
maintained by the VICAR system programmer. <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> History items in the VICAR label include:
<PRE>
TASK		a proc that has processed the dataset
USER		user identification (login id.)
DAT_TIM		processing date and time
optional items	added by the application proc listed under task
</PRE>

<I>Example:</I> History items added by VICAR 

<PRE>
	TASK='RESSAR77'
	USER='USERID'
	DAT_TIM='Wed Nov 12 19:06:24 1986'
	PIX_CNT=22259
	PARMS='AUTO-STRETCH:    0 to    0 and   138 to   255'
</PRE>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The contents of a VICAR label may be listed
either as formatted ASCII or as an ASCII dump (<A
