The VICAR software set has been designed with transportability in
mind, and the bulk of the software is truly transportable to other
machines, including those running UNIX.  However, in order to benefit
by and utilize certain hardware and proprietary software packages
apvailable at the MIPS site, a subset of VICAR is facility-specific
(some is, in fact, machine-specific) and thus non-standard.  This
subset will not work unless this hardware or software is resident (see
the system manager for configuration details). <P>

<A NAME="Transportation:Data">
Transportation of data to or from a VICAR facility is supported in
either VICAR or non-VICAR format.  A  set of application
programs are available which convert from VICAR to specific non-VICAR
formats (e.g., Voyager EDR format), and from specific non-VICAR
formats (e.g., FITS format) to VICAR format. <P></A>

The purpose of this section is to describe these subsets of VICAR, the
non-standard items. <P>

<A NAME="8.1">
<H2>8.1	Proprietary Software</H2>
</A>

Proprietary software packages utilized by VICAR applications procs are: 
<UL>
<LI>the VAX Datatrieve data management system from Digital Equipment
Corporation 
<LI>the Floating Point Systems (FPS) array processor library
<LI>the PRINTRONIX plotting routines from Cerritos Computer Systems
Incorporated
<LI>The Sybase data management system from Sybase for UNIX
<LI>the  Image Display Manager (IDM)
</Ul>

Specific procs which call or link to this proprietary software are
listed below and are described in more detail in <A
HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.3">Appendix 10.3</A>.
Asterisks,"*", indicate that the proc will utilize proprietary
software if it is available, but, if not, will use less efficient but
non-proprietary software.  Pluses, "+", indicate that the proc will
utilize proprietary software only in some of its operating modes.  If
the proc name has no asterisk or plus, it will only be available on
systems with the specified software.  <P>

Peripherals at the MIPS site include display processors,

hardware are listed below and are described in more detail in <A

<A NAME="8.3">
<H2>8.3	VICAR I/O Formats</H2>
</A>

<A NAME="Transportation:Data" /A> Transportation of data to or from a
VICAR facility is performed using tape media, cd-rom or network
transfer.  VMS VICAR supports tapes with and without ANSI labels.  The
tape densities that are supported are 800, 1600 and 6250 on 9 track
tape.  8mm and 4mm data tapes are also used.  The data transfer is
accomplished with applications procs. The tape handling commands are
<CODE>ALLOC</CODE>, <CODE>DEALLOC</CODE>, <CODE>MOUNT</CODE>,
<CODE>DISMOUNT</CODE> and <CODE>REWIND</CODE>. For UNIX, a simple tar
command will transfer data to either 8mm or 4mm data tapes.  The
network can be used to transfer data as long as the VICAR site has an
anonymous FTP.  <P>

<A NAME="8.3.1">
<H3>8.3.1 Input/Output of VICAR Datasets</H3>
</A>

VICAR is able to output data in a format that most other sites can
handle.  Under VMS, the capability exists to output datasets with or
without VICAR labels, either blocked (n logical records per physical
record) or unblocked (1 logical record per physical record).  The
procs <CODE>LABEL-REMOVE</CODE> or <CODE>COPY</CODE> are generally
used for this purpose. <P>

<A NAME="8.3.2">
<H3>8.3.2 Output of Non-VICAR Datasets</H3>
</A>

Using the VICAR I/O subroutines (see the VICAR Run-time Library
Reference Manual), it is possible to generate output datasets in any
format desired.  The programs which currently do this and their output
formats are described below.  For program descriptions, see <A
HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.3">Appendix 10.3</A>. <P>

  		Record 
EDRGEN		Voyager Experiment Data Record 
PSCRIPT		Converts VICAR images into a Postscript file
TAPES		optionally, EBCDIC
VCOPOUT		ASCII Text
VMAC		Transfers data between PICT or TIFF format
		images and IMG files
VTIFF		Convert between VICAR labeled images and TIFF 
		format files
WRISOUT		U.S. Forest Service WRIS exchange format
</PRE>

<A NAME="8.3.3">
<H3>8.3.3 Input of Non-VICAR Datasets</H3>
</A>

Unlabeled tape datasets, blocked or unblocked, can be converted to
VICAR format using the proc <CODE>CONVIM</CODE> or
<CODE>LABEL-CREATE</CODE>. However, special purpose programs, called
logging programs, are often written to extract special information
from the data, construct special VICAR labels or unpack the data in
unique ways.  The programs which currently do this and their input
formats are listed below.  For program descriptions, see <A
HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.3">Appendix 10.3</A>. <P>
