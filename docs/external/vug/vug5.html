</PRE>

Within the following section, different aspects of the VICAR
environment will be covered.  The user will be introduced to the VICAR
Library, processing modes, and subprocesses. The user will learn how
to customize a VICAR session and abort a VICAR command.  The novice
user should note that several concepts presented in this section are
explained in more detail later on in this document. <P>

<A NAME="5.1">
<H2>5.1	VICAR Libraries</H2>
</A>

Seven libraries contain the executive, applications and system
routines within VICAR.  Each library is known by its system-wide
logical name or environment variable (pointing to a system
sub-directory). <P>

<PRE>
<STRONG>  	 LIBRARY 	   	CONTENTS	
     VMS         UNIX</STRONG>
    V2$LIB 	$V2LIB		VICAR executive routines  
    VIDS$LIB	$VIDSLIB	VICAR system routines

    R2LIB 	$R2LIB		Application procs
    R3LIB 	$R3LIB		Application procs
    M2LIB	$TAEMENU	Menus
</PRE><P>

Three libraries are available for application procs so that a facility
may segregate its procs as it chooses. <P>

VICAR establishes a default search hierarchy containing these seven
libraries, as well as the user's current default directory.  A change
of the current default directory after entry into VICAR is not
reflected in the search hierarchy.  The user may bypass all such
searches by explicitly prefixing the proc name with the library name
and a colon (e.g., <CODE>R2LIB:STRETCH</CODE>). <P>

The user may display the currently established search hierarchy at any
time with the command <CODE>show</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug10.4-10.html">Appendix 10.4</A>).  The default hierarchy is
listed below with the search being from top to bottom. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Show user's library hierarchy.  <P>

Within each library, compiled PDFs (file type <CODE>.cpd</CODE>)
are given preference over slower, uncompiled PDFs (file type
<CODE>.pdf</CODE>).  Therefore, a program which has a
<CODE>.cpd</CODE> and a <CODE>.pdf</CODE> will always have its faster
version chosen.  See <A HREF="vug7.html#7.3.6">Section 7.3.6</A> for
more information on compiled PDFs. <P>

This default hierarchy is easily altered either with the use of the
intrinsic command <CODE>setlib</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug10.4-10.html">Appendix 10.4</A>), or within the user's ULOGON
procedure (<A HREF="vug5.html#5.4.1">Section 5.4.1</A>). <P>

<A NAME="5.2">
<H2>5.2	Processing Modes</H2>
</A>

The user has several types of processing modes available within VICAR.
Each mode is described in detail within this section. <P>

<UL>
<LI>Interactive/Synchronous processing mode
<LI>Asynchronous processing mode
<LI>Batch processing mode  
</UL>

<A NAME="5.2.1" /A>
<H3>5.2.1 Interactive or Synchronous Processing Mode</H3>
<P>
When a user communicates directly with VICAR by means of a terminal,
and VICAR immediately acknowledges and executes the user's requests,
the user is in the "interactive processing mode".  Within the
interactive session the user might use:<P>
<UL>

<LI>The Tutor mode - to learn more about procs and the parameters
associated with them (<A HREF="vug6.html#6.2">Section 6.2</A>)  
<LI>The Menu mode - to select or execute application procs (<A
HREF="vug6.html#6.3">Section 6.3</A>) <A NAME="Proc:Invocation" /A> 
<LI>VICAR Command mode - to execute procs or intrinsic commands
(<A HREF="vug7.html#7.1">Section 7.1</A>) 
<LI>VICAR DCL or USH mode - to execute DCL or shell commands (see below)
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5.2.1.1">
<H4>5.2.1.1 VICAR DCL Mode - VMS Systems</H4>
</A>

On VMS systems, the user has the ability to execute DCL commands
without leaving the VICAR environment.  The user can execute a single
DCL command, or actually enter the DCL mode while still within
VICAR. <P>

In the first case, the user is able to execute a one line DCL command
by typing <CODE>DCL</CODE> and the command. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Execute a DCL command from VICAR.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>DCL SHOW DEV MTA0
</PRE>

If the user wanted to do something in DCL that requires more than a
single command line, a second method is available.  If, for example,
the user wanted to send a mail message or edit a file,
<CODE>DCL</CODE> would be typed at the VICAR prompt.  The user would
then receive a new prompt, <CODE>_$</CODE>, indicating that the DCL
mode of VICAR had been entered. <P>

<I>Syntax:</I>  Enter VICAR's DCL mode.
<A NAME="DCL Mode:Entering" /A>
<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>DCL
    <STRONG>_$</STRONG>
</PRE><P>

Within this mode the user is able to do almost everything that could
be done in the normal DCL mode.  Some DCL programs may not work in
VICAR's DCL mode. <P>

The normal VICAR mode can be re-entered by typing <CODE>EXIT</CODE>,
<CODE>VICAR</CODE> or <CODE>Control-Z</CODE>. <P>
</A>

<I>Syntax:</I> Return to VICAR from DCL mode.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>_$</STRONG> EXIT
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>
</PRE><P>

<A NAME="5.2.1.2">
<H4>5.2.1.2 VICAR USH Mode - UNIX Systems</H4>
</A>

Similarly, on UNIX systems, the user has the ability to execute UNIX
shell commands without leaving the VICAR environment by typing
<CODE>ush</CODE> at the command line.  (USH stands for User SHell.)
However, <CODE>ush</CODE> should be used much less frequently than
<CODE>dcl</CODE> is, because in a windowing environment it makes more
sense to open another window than to suspend VICAR in order to execute
shell commands.  The <CODE>ush</CODE> command should be used primarily
in procs rather than interactively. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Execute a USH command from VICAR.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>ush df
</PRE>

<I>Syntax:</I>  Enter VICAR's USH mode.

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>ush
    <STRONG>%</STRONG>
</PRE><P>

The 'shell' that is invoked is the command interpreter 'sh' or 'csh'
as defined by the symbol <CODE>SHELL</CODE> when you logged in.  You
may redefine the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE> from 'sh' to 'csh' or
vice versa before invoking TAE. <P>

The normal VICAR mode can be re-entered by typing
<CODE>Control-D</CODE>, or <CODE>exit</CODE> at the shell prompt. <P>

<I>Syntax:</I> Return to VICAR from USH mode.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>%</STRONG> exit
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>
</PRE><P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <I>Changing the default device/directory via
the shell command <CODE>cd</CODE> while in USH mode or terminating a
USH command with a backslash (<CODE>\</CODE>) will cause TAE to
malfunction.</I> <P>

<A NAME="5.2.2">
<H3>5.2.2 Asynchronous Processing</H3>
</A>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The Asynchronous processing mode allows a user
to execute a proc in a separate subprocess without interfering with
the user's current interactive session.  This mode may sometimes be
preferable to the Batch mode because the separate subprocess runs
simultaneously with, and at the same priority as, the interactive
session.  The user's interactive environment is duplicated in the
asynchronous subprocess, thus relieving the user from having to
redefine commands and globals. More than one asynchronous job may run
at the same time.  Once submitted, the job is executed
immediately. <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> Because asynchronous jobs are executing in a
separate subprocess, they cannot directly communicate with the user's
terminal.  However, they may communicate indirectly by requesting
additional parameter inputs.  See the <CITE>TAE Command Language
User's Manual</CITE> and <A HREF="vug7.html#7.2.5">Section 7.2.5</A>
for further information on these "dynamic parameters". <P>

<A NAME="5.2.2.1">
<H4>5.2.2.1 Asynchronous Processing - VMS Systems</H4>
</A>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> For asynchronous jobs run on a VMS system, the
VICAR runstream information is written into a log file named
<VAR>PROCNAME</VAR>.TML. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Submit <CODE>TESTGEN.PDF</CODE> as an asynchronous
job.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>TESTGEN|RUNTYPE=ASYNC|
    <STRONG>[TAE-ASYNCJOB]Asynchronous job 'TESTGEN' initiated.</STRONG>
</PRE>
<P>
The user may check on the status of the job with the intrinsic command
<CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Monitor the progress of <CODE>TESTGEN</CODE><P>
<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>SHOW-ASYNC

	NAME 	    PROC 	STATE 	SFI 	SKEY

	TESTGEN	    TESTGEN	ACTIVE	0	TESTGEN
</PRE>
<P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG></A> <I>The user should not exit a VICAR
interactive session while asynchronous jobs are executing.  If this
happens, all asynchronous jobs will be aborted. </I><P>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <I>The user is also advised to avoid using
tape operations within the Asynchronous mode until a known bug can be
corrected.  Tape drives can be successfully allocated, mounted,
written or read.  However, the tapes cannot be successfully dismounted
and/or remounted within the Asynchronous mode. </I><P> 

<A NAME="5.2.2.2">
<H4>5.2.2.2 "Background" Processing - UNIX Systems</H4>
</A>

VICAR running on UNIX systems does not have an "asynchronous mode";
given that a user can have several windows open at the same time, it
is usually unnecessary. However, processing jobs in the "background"
is similar in concept.   <P>

To do this, your proc will need to be submitted from the shell
prompt. <P> 

<EM>Example:</EM> Submitting a VICAR proc from the shell
prompt. (Note: this only works on SunOS, not Sun Solaris systems.) <P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>%</STRONG> cat test.pdf
    <STRONG>Procedure	!test
    Body
    slogon
    gen out.img 10 10
    label-list out.img
    ush ps
    End-proc</STRONG>
    <STRONG>%</STRONG> taetm test &gt; test.log &amp;
    <STRONG>[1] 9147</STRONG>
</PRE>

The <CODE>slogon</CODE> statement in the proc after the
<CODE>Body</CODE> command is necessary if the proc is going to be run
from the UNIX shell prompt.  However, it may not be present when
running the proc from the VICAR command line.  The &gt; sign redirects
the output from the proc to the file <CODE>test.log</CODE>, rather
than to your screen.  (There is currently a bug in VICAR, such that
the output is not written to the output file in the correct order.
This should be fixed in future versions.)  The ampersand (&amp;)
forces the job into the background.  Typing <CODE>fg</CODE> at the
prompt will bring the job back into the foreground. <P>

<A NAME="5.2.3">
<H3>5.2.3 Batch Processing Mode</H3>
</A>

The user may wish to execute a proc in batch.  Batch processing is
achieved by means of submitting a file, commonly referred to as a job,
to a batch queue which will create the proper environment to execute a
proc.  Upon submitting the file, the user relinquishes control of the
job to the operating system, thus freeing the terminal and allowing
the user to continue with other tasks.  The user may check on the
status of the job with the intrinsic command <CODE>SHOW</CODE>. <P>


<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <I>The default directory for a batch job is
the directory from which the submittal occurred.  If submitted from a
subdirectory, all file names should be fully qualified because this
subdirectory may not exist on all disks referred to in the
job. </I><P>

<A NAME="5.2.3.1">
<H4>5.2.2.1 Batch Processing - VMS Systems</H4>
</A>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> There are several ways to invoke batch
processing in VICAR on VMS systems.  This section will address the
VAX/VMS default batch queue, <CODE>SYS$BATCH</CODE>.  If this queue is
not on the user's system, consult the local system manager for
information on what is available. <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> One way to create a batch process is to use
the intrinsic command <CODE>BATCH-SUBMIT</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug10.4-10.html">Appendix 10.4</A>).  After Tutoring on a
desired proc and performing a Tutor <CODE>SAVE</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug10.4-10.html#10.8">Appendix 10.8</A>) on the parameter values
selected, the user can submit a job with the <CODE>BATCH-SUBMIT</CODE>
command.  This can be done in a Tutor session on
<CODE>BATCH-SUBMIT</CODE> or interactively. <P>

<I>Syntax:</I><P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>BATCH-SUBMIT PROC=<VAR>proc_name</VAR> +
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;+</STRONG> SAVEFILE=<VAR>savefile_name</VAR> QUEUE=<VAR>queue_name</VAR> +
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;+</STRONG> STDOUT=<VAR>output_file</VAR>
</PRE>

<I>Example:</I> After specifying parameters in Tutor on proc <CODE>GEN</CODE>,
	submit to batch queue.

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG> BATCH-SUBMIT PROC=GEN.PDF SAVE=GEN.PAR 
    <STRONG>Job 2038 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH</STRONG>
</PRE>

<I>later:</I>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>Job GEN (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 2038) completed</STRONG>
</PRE><P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> Another method for submittim a job is to use
the command qualifier <CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> (<A
HREF="vug7.html#7.2.1.3">Section 7.2.1.3</A>).  Specifying a valid
<VAR>queue_name</VAR> or <CODE>NORUN</CODE> will produce two different
submitting techniques.  Specifying <CODE>SYS$BATCH</CODE> as the
<VAR>queue_name</VAR> causes the job to be automatically placed in
that queue and executed. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Submit proc <CODE>TESTGEN</CODE> to batch queue
<CODE>SYS$BATCH</CODE><P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>TESTGEN |RUNTYPE=(BATCH, SYS$BATCH)| 
    <STRONG>Job 2039 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH</STRONG>

    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>SHOW-BATCH SYS$BATCH 
    <STRONG>Batch queue MIPL1_SYS$BATCH, on MIPL1::

	Jobname	    Username	Entry	Status

	TESTGEN	     USERID	2039	Executing
</STRONG></PRE>

<I>later:</I>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>Job TESTGEN (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 2039) completed</STRONG>
</PRE>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> Specifying <CODE>NORUN</CODE> as the
queue name disables the act of job submittal.  Instead, a job file is
created containing all commands needed to execute the proc in batch.
This method allows the user to issue the <CODE>DCL SUBMIT</CODE>
command with any or all of its associated qualifiers, rather than
accepting the VICAR defaults. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Create the job file for <CODE>TESTGEN</CODE> proc
before submitting it. <P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG> TESTGEN|RUNTYPE=(BATCH,NORUN)|
    <STRONG>Created batch job file 'TESTGEN.JOB'.</STRONG>
</PRE>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The <CODE>.JOB</CODE> file
(<CODE>TESTGEN.JOB</CODE> for this example) would then be submitted
using the <CODE>DCL SUBMIT</CODE> command, unless other provisions
have been made by the system manager. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Submit <CODE>TESTGEN.JOB</CODE> to
<CODE>SYS$BATCH</CODE> queue.<P>

<PRE>
  <STRONG>VICAR&gt;</STRONG>DCL SUBMIT/NOPRINT/NOTIFY TESTGEN.JOB
  <STRONG>Job TESTGEN (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 2041) started on SYS$BATCH</STRONG>
</PRE>

<I>later:</I>

<PRE>
  <STRONG>Job TESTGEN (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 2041) completed</STRONG>
</PRE>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> Upon completion of a batch job, the user can
access a file containing all of the processing information collected
during the batch job execution.  The log file is located in the
directory from which the job was submitted, and it is called
<VAR>PROCNAME</VAR>.LOG (<CODE>TESTGEN.LOG</CODE> for the above
example). <P>

<STRONG>EXPERT</STRONG> The user may also delete a batch job at any
time.<P>

<A NAME="5.2.3.2">
<H4>5.2.3.2 Batch Processing - UNIX Systems</H4>
</A>

Formal batch processing does not exist on UNIX systems at the current
time.  However, it is possible to submit a job to run at a later time,
perhaps when the system load will be lower.  This may be done by
creating a shell script to initiate your proc.  This shell script is
submitted as a "batch" job by using the UNIX <CODE>at</CODE> command.
(The UNIX <CODE>cron</CODE> command could also be used.) <P>

<EM>Example:</EM> Use of the <CODE>at</CODE> command on a SunOS
system.  (Batch processing doesn't work on Solaris systems currently,
but when it does, be aware that the <CODE>at</CODE> command has a
slightly different syntax on those systems.) <P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>%</STRONG> cat submit_test.sh
    <STRONG>#!/bin/sh
    taetm test</STRONG>
    <STRONG>%</STRONG> at 23:00 submit_test.sh
    <STRONG>job 11719 at Tue Aug  9 23:00:00 1994</STRONG>
</PRE>

(Remember to turn the execution permission for your shell script on
using the UNIX command <CODE>chmod u+x submit_test.sh</CODE>).  You
will receive a mail message containing the output from your job when
it is completed.  As stated above in <A HREF="#5.2.2.2">Section
5.2.2.2</A>, there is currently a bug in the output files from these
batch jobs. <P>

<A NAME="5.3"> 
<H2>5.3 VICAR Use of Subprocesses</H2> 
</A>

This section is relevant for VMS systems only. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> The VICAR
executive makes use of VMS subprocesses to establish environments and
isolate functions.  This discussion is intended to clarify how a
user's session is being supported under the VMS operating system. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> A user logged in under VMS has a process
associated with the session, e.g., process name <CODE>PRCNM</CODE>.
Entering the command VICAR starts a VMS subprocess with a process name
<CODE>PRCNM1</CODE>.  This subprocess is the environment under which
all VICAR operations are handled.  The VICAR <CODE>EXIT</CODE> command
returns the user to the parent VMS process and deletes the subprocess
and all its descendent subprocesses. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> In the case of a batch job submittal (<A
HREF="#5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</A>) from VICAR, a separate VMS process is
initiated.  The name of the submitted procedure PDF is taken as the
process name of the batch job, e.g., <CODE>MYPDF</CODE>.  When the job
begins to execute, a subprocess (<CODE>MYPDF1</CODE>) is created as
the environment from which the VICAR commands are executed.  Both
process and subprocess, of course, go away at job termination. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> Asynchronous processes (<A
HREF="#5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</A>) are handled similarly.  They differ
from batch jobs in that a subprocess is initiated under which a second
subprocess is created for the VICAR environment.  The process name of
the first subprocess is created by concatenating the eight character
Process ID number of the VMS process with the first four characters of
the PDF being run and appending a character zero.  Therefore, the
first subprocess may have a process name like
<CODE>22058225IMAG0</CODE>.  The second subprocess gets that name with
a "<CODE>1</CODE>" appended to it. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> The following diagram illustrates the
relationships of the VMS processes and subprocesses utilized by
VICAR. <P>

<IMG SRC="fig.5.3.1.gif"><P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> Because of this interesting relationship of
processes and subprocesses, a user must realize that observing the
progress of a process with a DCL SHOW SYSTEM command, for instance,
may be meaningless because most of the action is occurring within one
or more subprocesses. <P>

<STRONG>WIZARD</STRONG> Normally, actions performed in DCL mode of
VICAR will take place in the subprocess.  It is possible, however, to
affect the parent process as well (see <A
HREF="vug7.html#7.2.1.1">Section 7.2.1.1</A> for more discussion in
this area).  DCL commands which allow the /JOB qualifier affect both
the parent and the subprocess when the qualifier is present. <P>

subprocess. <P>

<A NAME="5.4">
<H2>5.4	Session-customizing </H2>
</A>

Logon and logoff procedures are used by VICAR to create the proper
environment.  VICAR invokes its own logon and logoff system procedures
upon entering and exiting the system.  The session may be further
customized by the execution of the user's logon and logoff procedures.
The creation of the user procedures are explained in the following
sections.  The examples presented are very useful and might be used as
a starting point. <P>

<A NAME="5.4.1">

<CODE>slogon</CODE>, is invoked.  <CODE>slogon</CODE> is a
facility-dependent logon procedure which is normally invisible to the
interactive user and is typically created and maintained by the system
manager.  Once VICAR has been invoked, the operating system executes
this logon procedure and a series of steps are executed in order to
set up the VICAR environment.  One of the last steps in the startup
procedure is to examine the user's present directory for a
<CODE>ulogon.pdf</CODE> and to execute that procedure if it
exists. <P>

The <CODE>ulogon</CODE> is a procedure typically written and
maintained by the user in order to customize the initialization of the
VICAR.  The <CODE>ulogon</CODE> is not a required procedure but most
users find it very useful.  For example, the <CODE>ulogon</CODE> can
be used to define the user's VICAR commands, specify the location of
the directories where the user's application software resides or to
configure the user's VICAR session.  <P>

<I>Example:</I> ulogon.pdf (A detailed, line-by-line, description can
be found in <A HREF="vug10.11-12.html#example3">Appendix
10.11</A>). <P>

The user may define a VMS logical name to point to a
<CODE>ulogon</CODE>.  Doing this causes the same <CODE>ulogon</CODE>
to be executed regardless of the default directory.  At the current
time, this cannot be done on UNIX systems, and a user must have a copy
of their <CODE>ulogon.pdf</CODE> in each directory from which they
wish to run VICAR. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Define a VMS logical name, in user's LOGIN.COM,
pointing to user's <CODE>ULOGON</CODE>. <P>

<PRE>
    $DEFINE ULOGON MGN4:[USERID]ULOGON.PDF  
</PRE>

Alternatively, the user could have a custom <CODE>ulogon</CODE> in
each directory by not defining the logical name and maintaining
separate <CODE>ulogon</CODE>s. <P>

<A NAME="5.4.2">
<H3>5.4.2 Logoff Procedures</H3>
</A>

The <CODE>slogoff</CODE> is a facility-dependent logoff procedure
which is activated when the user exits from VICAR.  One of the steps
in the procedure is to examine the user's current directory for a
<CODE>ulogoff.pdf</CODE> and to execute that procedure if it
exists. <P>

The <CODE>ulogoff</CODE> is typically written and maintained by the
user in order to customize the exiting from the VICAR session.  The
<CODE>ulogoff</CODE> is not a required procedure but some users find
it to be very useful for directory maintenance.  For example, the
<CODE>ulogoff</CODE> can be used to delete unnecessary files from the
user's directories or to automatically print out the latest version of
the <CODE>session.log</CODE>. <P>

<I>Example:</I> ulogoff.pdf (A detailed, line-by-line, description can
be found in <A HREF="vug10.11-12.html#example4">Appendix 10.11</A>)
<P>

<PRE>
    Procedure
    Body
    DISABLE-LOG
    ush /bin/rm last.par
    ush /bin/rm session.tsl
    ush lpr session.log
    End-proc
</PRE>

As with the <CODE>ulogon</CODE> the user should define a VMS logical
name to point to a <CODE>ulogoff</CODE>. Doing this causes the same
<CODE>ulogoff</CODE> to be executed regardless of the default
directory.  (Again, this is not currently possible on UNIX systems.)
<P>

<I>Example:</I> Define a VMS logical name, in user's LOGIN.COM,
pointing to user's <CODE>ulogoff</CODE>. <P>

<PRE>
    $DEFINE ULOGOFF SYS$LOGIN:ULOGOFF.PDF
</PRE>

Alternatively, the user could have a custom <CODE>ulogoff</CODE> in each
directory by not defining the logical name and maintaining separate
<CODE>ulogoff</CODE>s. <P>

<A NAME="5.5">
<H2>5.5	Aborting a VICAR Command</H2>
</A>

VICAR provides the user with the ability to interrupt a VICAR
operation once execution has started. VICAR has defined the key
sequence <CODE>Control-C</CODE> to activate "proc interrupt mode".
Upon entering <CODE>Control-C</CODE>, the operation is suspended and
the user is prompted by the "interrupt prompt" for appropriate
commands. <P>

<I>Syntax:</I><P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR-INTERRUPT&gt;</STRONG>command
</PRE>

The user may enter one of the following commands:<P>

<UL>
<LI>ABORT - This forces termination of the operation and returns the
user to normal VICAR Command mode
<LI>CONTINUE - This resumes the operation
<LI>Other VICAR Intrinsic commands (Appendix 10.4).  
</UL>

Note: If a synchronous proc is invoked, the following error is
issued:<P> 
<PRE>
    <STRONG>[TAE-NOSYNC] Synchronous procs not available in proc 
interrupt mode.</STRONG>
</PRE>

While a proc is interrupted, it is valuable to be able to perform
Intrinsic commands and then resume the proc.  The commands will take
effect immediately. <P>

<I>Example:</I> Specify an Intrinsic command and resume a proc.<P>

<PRE>
    <STRONG>VICAR-INTERRUPT&gt;</STRONG>let $echo="yes"
    <STRONG>VICAR-INTERRUPT&gt;</STRONG>continue
</PRE>

<STRONG>BEWARE</STRONG> <CODE>Control-C</CODE> is the only sequence
defined for "Proc interrupt mode".  Other control characters will have
very different results.  (See <A HREF="vug7.html#7.1.1.5">Section
7.1.1.5</A> for more information.) <P>
