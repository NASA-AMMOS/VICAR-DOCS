<Title>VICAR User's Guide - Appendix 13</Title>
<H2>10.13 VICAR Message Explanations</H2>

The list of error messages is kept in $TAEHELP/msg/taefac.msg on UNIX
machines, and VICSYS:[VICAR121.TAE52_VAX-VMS.HELP.TM]TAEFAC.MSG on VAX
machines. This appendix contains the VICAR error and information
messages listed, by key, in alphabetical order. If the user receives a
message not listed here, further information may be obtained by typing
"<CODE>?</CODE>" or by using the <CODE>help-message</CODE> command
(Sections <A HREF="vug6.html#6.5.2">6.5.2</A> and <A
HREF="vug6.html#6.5.3">6.5.3</A>). <P>

<STRONG>KEY</STRONG> Explanation and User Actions
<HR>
<STRONG>ABNSHELL</STRONG> The last command executed by the
UNIX/shell, invoked via the USH command from TAE, has terminated
abnormally. Resubmit the shell command correctly. <P>

<STRONG>ABORT</STRONG> The TCL global variable $SKEY will assume
this value after you have typed an ABORT command. <P>

<STRONG>ABORTOK</STRONG> This is an information message, indicating
that the specified asynchronous job has been successfully aborted.
<P>

<STRONG>ABOWAIT</STRONG> This is the value of the TCL global
variable $SKEY after the user has used the attention sequence to abort
a WAIT command. <P>

<STRONG>ACCERR</STRONG> Defined ACCESS values are: IN - the file
exists; OUT - the file will be created; INOUT - the file exists and
can be written to; and NOCHECK - no check is to be made. Correct the
ACCESS specification according to one of the options listed above. <P> 

<STRONG>ACCNOTALL</STRONG> ACCESS is only allowed for
<CODE>FILE</CODE> variables. Change the variable type or delete the
ACCESS clause. <P>

<STRONG>ALLOC</STRONG> You have attempted to allocate or deallocate
a tape drive which is already allocated to another user. Allocate an
alternate tape drive or wait for the user of the current drive to
deallocate it. <P>

<STRONG>ALLOCLOG</STRONG> VICAR was unable to define the logical
name in the job table for the ALLOC command. This logical name is the
same as the symbolic name, with a value of the actual device name. The
host message given with this key should explain the error further.
Interpret the host message and act accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>AMBIGPAR</STRONG> The abbreviation used for a parameter
identifies more than one parameter for this command. Use more
characters in the name of the parameter. Use <CODE>TUTOR</CODE> to
determine the full name for the parameter. <P>

<STRONG>AMBIGSUB</STRONG> The abbreviation used for a subcommand
identifies more than one subcommand for this command. Use more
characters in the name of the subcommand. If you do not know the
correct name of the subcommand, request the TUTOR subcommand display
by typing: <CODE>TUTOR <VAR>commandname-</VAR></CODE> <P>

<STRONG>AMBIGVAL</STRONG> An "ambiguous" value was assigned to a
variable. An ambiguous value is a value that is the left substring of
more than one of the valid values for the variable. Determine the
valid values for the variable (by requesting help on a parameter in
TUTOR or by finding the declaration statement for the variable and
consulting its "VALID" list), and re-type the errant command using a
unique substring of the desired value. <P>

<STRONG>ARESTERR</STRONG> In an asynchronous job, there was an error
updating the job context with the results of a dynamic parameter
session. Because the results are communicated to the asynchronous TAE
monitor through files, this error generally occurs when another user
has created a file with the same name as the communication file. See
the TAE system manager for an explanation of the naming of TAE
communication files. <P>

<STRONG>ARIERR</STRONG> One of the following occurred: 1) The result
of an integer addition or multiplication is greater than the greatest
integer that can be held in the host system. 2) The result of a
floating point addition or multiplication is greater than the largest
floating point number that can be held in the host system. 3) The
result of a floating point division requires too much precision for
floating point numbers in the host system. See local system
documentation or the System Manager to determine the possible size of
numbers on your system, and correct the command or procedure
accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>ASGNFAIL</STRONG> The host returned an error when attempting
to assign a channel to the tape drive in order to do a rewind. The
host message given with this key should explain the error. Interpret
the host message and act accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>ASYCRE</STRONG> TAE is unable to initiate an asynchronous
job because certain resource quotas (assigned to the user by the
system manager), have been exceeded. If your problem is related to
resource quotas (indicated by a VAX/VMS error code of 28), and you do
not have any asynchronous jobs active, see your system manager to
increase your quotas. The TAE Systems Manager's guide has guidelines
for quota assignments. Otherwise, if you have active asynchronous
jobs, wait until one of them completes. You may check the status of
asynchronous jobs with the SHOW-ASYNC command. <P>

<STRONG>ASYINTRPT</STRONG> This is an information message. The user
typed the attention sequence (e.g., <CODE>CONTROL/C</CODE>)
after"<CODE>REPLY</CODE>ing" to and "<CODE>RUN</CODE>ning" an
asynchronous proc. One reason for doing this might be that the TM
subprocess created to execute the asynchronous job was terminated. The
parent TM then "hangs" while attempting to send a message (via the
<CODE>reply_do</CODE> subroutine call) to the TM subprocess. See
system manager to determine why the TM subprocess was terminated. <P>

<STRONG>ASYNCDONE</STRONG> This message informs the user that a job
invoked with the value of the command qualifier <CODE>ASYNCEND</CODE>
set to <CODE>NOTIFY</CODE> has terminated. No action required. <P>

<STRONG>ASYNCJOB</STRONG> This message informs the user that TAE was
successful in creating the asynchronous job. Note, however, that this
does not guarantee that the job will run; the job may abort because of
system quota limitations after a successful initiation. Check the
status of the submitted job by typing <CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>. If the
job could not be run, the <CODE>SKEY</CODE> field should contain a key
value such as <CODE>TAE-COMINI</CODE>.  <P>

<STRONG>ASYNCREQ</STRONG> This message informs the user that one or
more asynchronous jobs are waiting for dynamic parameters. The
<CODE>REPLY</CODE> command may be used to supply the parameter values
to the asynchronous job. Type <CODE>HELP REPLY</CODE> for additional
information. If more than one asynchronous job is active, find the
job(s) requesting the dynamic parameters by typing the
<CODE>SHOW-WAITING</CODE> command. Then use the <CODE>REPLY</CODE>
command, with job name if necessary, to initiate a dynamic parameter
session. <P>

<STRONG>ASYONLY</STRONG> The command you typed is only available from
within an asynchronous job; see the <CITE>TAE Command Language
Programmer's Manual</CITE> for an explanation of the use of this
command. <P>

<STRONG>ASYPARM</STRONG> An asynchronous proc invoked by either a
batch or asynchronous job requested dynamic parameters. TAE does not
support this request because there is no associated interactive user.
<P>

<STRONG>ASYRCV</STRONG> The asynchronous job, waiting for dynamic
parameters from the interactive TAE monitor, was unsuccessful in
receiving a reply message. Find an explanation for the host error
code printed with the error message. If you cannot correct the
problem, see your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>ASYSND</STRONG> The interactive TAE job is unable to send
parameters to the asynchronous job. The cause of the problem is
supplied as the host-dependent error code in the error message. Find
the explanation for the host-dependent error code printed with the
message. Correct the problem, if possible, and resubmit the job. If
you cannot correct the problem see your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>ASYRCV</STRONG> An error has been encountered by TAE in
receiving and processing a dynamic parameter request from an
asynchronous job. Find the explanation for the host-dependent error
code printed with the error message. See your system manager if you
cannot correct the problem. <P>

<STRONG>ATROOT</STRONG> The root menu is the currently displayed
menu. No action required. <P>

<STRONG>ATTN</STRONG> Should never be displayed. Referenced by code in
<CODE>tae$tm:misccmd.c</CODE> which, due to conditional compilation,
will never be compiled. <P>

<STRONG>BADABB</STRONG> An abbreviation was specified (using the
<CODE>abc*def</CODE> form) in which the asterisk was the first
character. You must specify at least one character before the
asterisk. Correct the input command accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>BADCMD</STRONG> The specified command is not available in the
mode in which it was used. It may or may not be available in some
other mode. The TCL command modes are normal mode and interrupt mode
(entered when you type the attention sequence to interrupt an
executing proc), and dynamic prompt mode (entered when you type two
escapes while prompted for additional input to a program or proc).
Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> while in a given mode to determine the commands
available in that mode. <P>

<STRONG>BADCOMBO</STRONG> A <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command may restore a
specified variable into an existing variable of a different name. You
may not restore into a target variable if you are restoring all
variables from a file. <P>

<STRONG>BADDECL</STRONG> A command appeared in a PDF before the
<CODE>BODY</CODE> command for procedures, or anywhere for processes,
that cannot be processed by the TAE interpreter. Only TCL
"declaration" commands may appear in process PDFs or before the
<CODE>BODY</CODE> command in procedures. If the proc is a procedure,
check that the <CODE>BODY</CODE> command is in the correct place. See
the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for the list
of TCL declaration commands. <P>

<STRONG>BADDEV</STRONG> You have entered a device specification
which is not recognized. Re-issue the command using the correct
device specification. <P>

<STRONG>BADESC</STRONG> <CODE>BREAK</CODE> and <CODE>NEXT</CODE>
commands are only valid inside a loop. Correct the PDF to delete the
<CODE>BREAK</CODE> or <CODE>NEXT</CODE>. Place it inside a loop as
appropriate. Descriptions of <CODE>BREAK</CODE> and <CODE>NEXT</CODE>
are available using the TCL commands <CODE>HELP BREAK</CODE> and
<CODE>HELP NEXT</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>BADFILE</STRONG> The named file cannot be found or the name of
the file is not correct for the local operating system. Determine if
the named file has correct spelling. If it does, see the TAE system
manager or Appendix A of the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's
Manual</CITE> to check for the format of correct file names on your
system. <P>

<STRONG>BADHLPDIR</STRONG> The help file contains an unrecognized
directive, that is, an unrecognized word following a period in column
one. Recognized directives in help files are: <CODE>.ELSEIF, .END,
.HELP, .IF, .IFEND, .INCLUDE, .LEVEL1, .LEVEL2, .PAGE, .SUBCMD,
.TITLE, .VARIABLE,</CODE> and <CODE>.VAR</CODE>. Examine the help file
and ensure that all directives are valid help directives. <P>

<STRONG>BADIVAL</STRONG> The left side of a <CODE>LET</CODE>
assignment statement is indexed but the right side does not represent
a singly-valued variable or constant. The number of component values
on the right side must be exactly one; the null value
("<CODE>--</CODE>") is not acceptable and multiple values are not
acceptable. Examples: 
<PRE>
	LET X(24) = 100		!valid 
	LET X(24) = --		!invalid: null value 
	LET X(24) = (1, 3)	!invalid: multiple values
</PRE>

<STRONG>BADJOBFILE</STRONG> The mechanism by which a TAE batch or
asynchronous job receives information from the initiating parent is
through a "job" file. If this message appears, the job file has been
corrupted. See the TAE system manager to list the job file and
determine the problem. <P>

<STRONG>BADKEY</STRONG> The proper format for a message key is
"xxx-yyy" and should be typed exactly as shown in the square brackets
([ and ]) of the error message. Type the key as indicated above. <P>

<STRONG>BADLET</STRONG> The valid form for the <CODE>LET</CODE> is
<CODE>LET <VAR>variable</VAR> = <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>. See the
section in the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE>
on expressions for more details. Correct the command to use the proper
form. <P>

<STRONG>BADLETSUBS</STRONG> The subscript in the <CODE>LET</CODE>
command has one of the following faults: 1) It is larger than the
largest subscript allowed for the variable. 2) It is more than one
greater than the current value count of the variable. 3) It is not a
positive integer. 4) It is multi-valued. Determine which of the above
faults is the cause of the error and fix the command accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>BADMENCMD</STRONG> The command is not a known menu command.
Correct the command. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> while in menu mode for a
list of menu commands. <P>

<STRONG>BADMENDIR</STRONG> The menu definition file contains an
unrecognized directive. (A word is interpreted as a menu directive if
it follows a period in column one in a menu definition file.) The menu
directives are: <CODE>.COMMAND, .TITLE, .PROC, .MENU, .HELP,</CODE>
and <CODE>.PAGE</CODE>.  Correct the menu file to use only the
directives listed above. <P>

<STRONG>BADMSG</STRONG> The TAE monitor has received a data
block from a process and the block has invalid format. This
represents a major failure in the TAE Monitor or in the TAE subroutine
library. <P>

<STRONG>BADNAME</STRONG> The specified variable does not exist. <P>

<STRONG>BADONFAIL</STRONG> In a procedure, the local variable
<CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> was set to a command that is not permitted as an
"onfail" command, or the onfail command is is an improper command (an
unsatisfied <CODE>GOTO</CODE>, for example). Correct the procedure to
set <CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> to a valid command. See the <CITE>TAE Command
Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for a list of allowed "onfail"
commands. <P>

<STRONG>BADOP</STRONG> One of the following operators was used
inappropriately: 1) The +, /, -, and * operators are restricted to
real and integer data types. 2) The // operator (concatenation) is
restricted to string data types. 3) The NOT, AND, and OR operators are
restricted to real and integer data types. 4) The >, <, >=, and <=
operators are restricted to real and integer data types. Determine the
cause of the incorrect usage and correct the command. <P>

<STRONG>BADPAR</STRONG> The parameter is not known to the command, or
an unknown command or parameter qualifier has been used. Every command
(or proc) has a defined set of parameter names, and only parameters
from this set may appear on the command line.  Note that the existence
of a subcommand changes the set of parameters, i.e., a command may
have different parameter sets depending upon the subcommand in
use. Re-enter the command, naming the parameters and any command or
parameter qualifiers correctly. You may use the TUTOR command to get
an exact list of the parameter names. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> for a
description of command and parameter qualifiers. See the <CITE>TAE
Command Language User's Manual</CITE> for details on qualifiers. <P>

<STRONG>BADPARENT</STRONG> In a <CODE>WINDOW-CREATE</CODE> operation,
a parent window was specified that doesn't exist. <P>

<STRONG>BADPARFILE</STRONG> An attempt was made to execute a PAR file
but the PAR file could not be recognized (that is, it did not have the
proper identifying flag). Try <CODE>disp-parfile</CODE> to display the
contents of the file. A probable cause is that the file was copied
over. <P>

<STRONG>BADPFILE</STRONG> Possible causes: 1) A parameter file read
during a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> or dynamic parameter operation does not
have a valid format for a parameter file. 2) The parameter file could
not be opened. 3) There was an error while reading the parameter
file. 4) The file was created by an older version of TAE. Type
<CODE>HELP CONVERT</CODE> or <CODE>TUTOR CONVERT</CODE> for
information on converting such files. Check the spelling of the file
name. If the spelling is correct, determine whether the named file was
created by a <CODE>SAVE</CODE> operation or by a process. If by a
process, determine if the process is properly using the
<CODE>XQWRTB</CODE> call. If the file could not be opened then the
file may not exist, or you may not have the privileges to read the
file. If there was an error while reading the parameter file, then the
file may be corrupted; see the TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>BADPQUAL</STRONG> A proc has been invoked with an incorrectly
formatted parameter qualifier. A parameter qualifier is a string
between two vertical bars following the value of a
parameter. Parameter qualifier values have the same format as
parameters. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's Manual</CITE>
for a description of parameter qualifiers and the proper format for
parameter values.  <P>

<STRONG>BADPROC</STRONG> An incorrectly formatted proc specification
was entered. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's Manual</CITE>
for the correct format of proc specs. <P>

<STRONG>BADQUERY</STRONG> The information requested on a window
could not be obtained. <P>

<STRONG>BADREF</STRONG> The definition of a proc parameter is
incorrect. The parameter is of type <CODE>NAME</CODE> but the
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> specification names a variable which is not
defined in the proc. <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> specifications for
<CODE>NAME</CODE> parameters are resolved locally. The proc definition
must be corrected. <P>

<STRONG>BADSIZE</STRONG> A program has attempted to set a string
variable to a string with more than the maximum number of characters
supported. See the TAE system manager to determine the maximum number
for characters and correct the program. (The maximum is set by the
<CODE>MAXSTRSIZ</CODE> parameter in the <CODE>TAECONF</CODE> file.)
<P>

<STRONG>BADTARG</STRONG> The user had issued a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE>
command to restore a set of variables from a previously saved file to
a different set of target variables. The number of
<CODE>VARIABLE</CODE> values does not match the number of
<CODE>TARGET</CODE>s. Reenter the command with matching number of
targets. <P>

<STRONG>BADTITLE</STRONG> The title block - the text following
<CODE>.TITLE</CODE> - in the help file or proc definition file is
incorrect. In general, the title is too long to fit on the
screen. Correct the text. <P>

<STRONG>BADTUTCMD</STRONG> The command is not a known TUTOR
command. Correct the command. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> for a list of
TUTOR commands. <P>

<STRONG>BADTYPE</STRONG> There is a type mismatch between a declared
parameter and the value provided for the parameter on the proc
invocation line. This often occurs when the de-reference operation is
used on a variable of a type different than the type expected by the
proc. Example: 
<PRE>
	local i integer 
	display @i	!'display' wants a string
</PRE>
Correct the invocation line so that the proc parameters use the
expected data types. <P>

<STRONG>BADVALCT</STRONG> The number of values specified for a
parameter is less than the minimum or more than the maximum defined
for the parameter. If the variable is a parameter defined via the
<CODE>PARM</CODE> statement, use <CODE>HELP-PARM</CODE> to determine
the allowable minimum and maximum number of values and re-issue the
command accordingly. If the variable was defined in a proc via the
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> statement, inspect the PDF file and determine the
allowable number of values by checking the <CODE>COUNT</CODE>
field. <P>

<STRONG>BATCHRUN</STRONG> On a UNIX system, the attempt to submit a
batch job failed. The most common cause of this error is a lack of
file descriptors in the TAE monitor. See your TAE system manager.
<P>

<STRONG>BCHOPN</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while creating the log
file for the batch job. Use local system utilities to check if you
have the appropriate privileges to write to the file. If you have used
the <CODE>DCL</CODE> command, <CODE>SET DEFAULT</CODE>, to change to
another user's directory, you may not have the appropriate
privileges. Use the local operating system I/O error code listed in
the error message to determine the source of the error. See the
documentation on the operating system or the System Manager for
further action. <P>

<STRONG>BCHRD</STRONG> The batch job file is the initial source of
commands when the TAE monitor is operating in batch mode. An I/O
error occurred while the TAE monitor was reading command records from
the submitted batch file. Use the local operating system I/O error
code listed in the error message to determine the source of the
error. See the documentation on the operating system or the TAE system
manager for further action. <P>

<STRONG>BCHSTAT</STRONG> Under VAX/VMS, the batch job status is
received from a mailbox. The attempt to create the mailbox has
failed. The VAX/VMS code is listed. Report the problem to the TAE
system manager. <P>

<STRONG>BCHWRT</STRONG> The batch job file is the file created when
a batch job is submitted. It contains the host-dependent batch
commands as well as the commands for the submitted proc. An I/O error
occurred while writing to this file. Use the local operating system
I/O error code listed in the error message to determine the source of
the error. See the documentation on the operating system or the System
Manager for further action. <P>

<STRONG>BIGSUBS</STRONG> The subscript specified for a variable is
larger than the maximum defined for that variable. If the variable is
a command parameter, use the TCL command <CODE>HELP-PARM
[<VAR>parameter name</VAR>] [<VAR>command name</VAR>]</CODE> or the
TUTOR command <CODE>HELP [<VAR>parameter name</VAR>]</CODE> to
determine the maximum number ofvalues for the parameter. If the
variable is a global variable, determine the name of the proc that
defines the global, enter TUTOR for that proc, and use TUTOR as above
to find information on the variable. If the variable is a local
variable defined in a PDF, check the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> command in the
PDF. <P>

<STRONG>BTNNACT</STRONG> The specified button has been disabled
since it has no meaning in the present context. Take some action
which will make the specified button relevant and thereby re-activate
the button. <P>

<STRONG>CANTALLDEV</STRONG> An attempt was made to allocate
(<CODE>USE</CODE>) a display device allocated to another user. Do a
<CODE>SHOWDISP</CODE> to determine which devices are available to be
allocated and <CODE>USE</CODE> one of them. <P>

<STRONG>CANTDALLDEV</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
deallocation routine while attempting to deallocate the device.
Report the error to the VRDI cognizant programmer. <P>

<STRONG>CMDCNFLCT</STRONG> <CODE>DEFCMD</CODE> may not used to replace
an existing command. Use a different name for the new command, or use
<CODE>DELCMD</CODE> to delete the old command. You may display a list
of the existing commands defined with <CODE>DEFCMD</CODE> by typing
<CODE>DISPLAY $DEFCMD0</CODE>.  <P>

<STRONG>CNTERR</STRONG> One of the values for <CODE>COUNT</CODE> in a
<CODE>PARM</CODE> or <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> declaration is less that one,
or greater than the maximum number of values allowed, or the
<CODE>COUNT</CODE> specification does not follow the proper
format. The proper format for <CODE>COUNT</CODE> is either a single
integer or "a:b", where "a" is the minimum number of values to be
allowed, and "b" is the maximum. <CODE>COUNT</CODE> will allow a 0 to
indicate a nullable parameter as long as there is a valid range given
as well, i.e. <CODE>COUNT=(0,4:20)</CODE> Correct the
<CODE>COUNT</CODE> specification. See the TAE system manager for the
maximum number of values allowed for a parameter on your system. <P>

<STRONG>COMINI</STRONG> For VAX_VMS: The TAE monitor, in its
initialization under VAX/VMS, creates a permanent subprocess. This
creation has failed. On VAX/VMS systems, the problem is often caused
by a depleted <CODE>BYTLM</CODE> quota or by exceeding the maximum
number of processes allowed in the system. Restart TAE and report the
problem to the TAE system manager. For UNIX: You should never receive
this error message from the Terminal monitor when running under UNIX.
Report the problem to the TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>COMMERR</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while receiving or
sending a message from a procedure via a path (a mailbox under VMS, a
socket under UNIX). The message usually contains parameters. Find an
explanation for the host error code printed with the error message. If
you cannot correct the problem, see your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>COMOPEN</STRONG> The TAE monitor could not open the file,
either containing information from the asynchronous job, or to be sent
to the asynchronous job. This may happen if you do not have write
access to the current default directory. Check the host-related
explanation given in the error message. If not related to protection
violation, inform your system manager. <P>

<STRONG>COMPDEFG</STRONG> A PDF contains a TCL command that cannot be
compiled. See the proc author or remove the command from the PDF. See
the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for a list
of commands that cannot be compiled. <P>

<STRONG>COMPDRFG</STRONG> A proc that de-references a global
variable (using the @ symbol) in the declaration section of the proc
cannot be compiled. <P>

<STRONG>COMPNULL</STRONG> The null value syntax ("<CODE>--</CODE>")
appeared as a list element of a multi-value list. The null value is
not acceptable as a component of another value. Individual components
of a variable may not be nulled; only the variable itself may be
nulled. Re-enter the command replacing the "<CODE>--</CODE>" with an
actual value. <P>

<STRONG>COMREAD</STRONG> After a <CODE>REPLY</CODE> command, the TAE
monitor could not read the asynchronous job communication file. Check
the explanation given in the error message. Inform your system
manager.  <P>

<STRONG>COMWRITE</STRONG> This is a TAE internal error. After a
<CODE>REPLY</CODE> command, the TAE monitor could not write the
dynamic parameter values to the asynchronous job communication
file. Check the host-specific explanation given in the error
message. Inform your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>COMWRT</STRONG> Following a <CODE>REPLY</CODE> command, the
TAE monitor could not write the dynamic parameter values, to the
communication file sent to the asynchronous job. This is an internal
or host system error. Check the explanation given in the error
message. Inform your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>CONCNULL</STRONG> One of the string variables in an expression
using the concatenation operator contained a null value
("<CODE>--</CODE>"). The null value is not allowed in a concatenation
operation.  The variable must be given a non-null string value. <P>

<STRONG>CONTROLC</STRONG> A <CODE>CONTROL/C</CODE> was entered while a
TCL procedure was waiting on X Window System events. No action may be
necessary. A procedure may disable interrupts by a procedure
declaration <CODE>PROCEDURE OPTIONS=NOINTERRUPT</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>CPDFBHDR</STRONG> The header in a compiled PDF was not
properly formatted. This error message generally indicates that the
compiled PDF was corrupted (or is not, in fact, a compiled PDF). <P>

<STRONG>CPDFMALF</STRONG> The symbol table in a compiled PDF was not
properly formatted. This error message generally indicates that the
compiled PDF was corrupted (or is not, in fact, a compiled PDF). <P>

<STRONG>CRELNMERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
allocation routine while attempting to create the logical name
required by the VRDI routines. Report the error to the VRDI cognizant
programmer. <P>

<STRONG>DALFAIL</STRONG> The DAL (Memory file Deallocate) operation
failed due to a host-specific problem. Interpret the host message and
act accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>DELNMERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
deallocation routine while attempting to delete the logical name
created by the device allocation routine. Report the error to the
VRDI cognizant programmer. <P>

<STRONG>DELREF</STRONG> A global variable may not be deleted if there
is a currently active proc with a <CODE>REFGBL</CODE> on that global.
Determine the procedure that references the global and either delete
the global after the proc terminates or remove the reference. <P>

<STRONG>DELVAR</STRONG> Certain local variables are implicitly defined
for all procs and may never be deleted. The <CODE>DELETE-LOCALS</CODE>
TCL command causes this message to be displayed and all non-implicit
local variables to be deleted. The implicitly defined local variables
are the following: 

<PRE>
	_PROC 	: the name of a proc 
	_SUBCMD : the active subcommand 
	_STDOUT : standard output file name 
	_ONFAIL : command to be executed upon error 
</PRE> 

Only <CODE>_STDOUT</CODE> is implicitly defined when TM is in
interactive mode. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Manual</CITE> for more details. <P>

<STRONG>DEVALLOC</STRONG> An attempt to allocate a display device
has been made when the device is already allocated. Use a different
device, or wait for it to be freed up. <P>

<STRONG>DEVNOTAVL</STRONG> An attempt has been made to allocate a
device which is not currently available for use. Allocate another
device. <P>

<STRONG>DFTERR</STRONG> The default or initial value does not conform
to the rest of the declaration. For example, a variable declared to be
an integer must have an integer default that is within the range
specified in the <CODE>VALID</CODE> specification. Correct the default
or initial value. Request <CODE>HELP</CODE> on the parameter in TUTOR
mode to display a list of the valid values for the parameter. <P>

<STRONG>DIBERROR</STRONG> An unexpected error occurred while reading
the device information block file. Have the VRDI cognizant programmer
correct the error. <P>

<STRONG>DIBOPEN</STRONG> An unexpected error occurred while opening
the device information block file. Have the VRDI cognizant programmer
correct the error. <P>

<STRONG>DISHOST</STRONG> For VAX/VMS: The <CODE>EXIT</CODE> and
<CODE>DCL</CODE> commands have been disabled. For UNIX: The
<CODE>EXIT</CODE> and <CODE>USH</CODE> commands have been disabled.
Continue working or execute the <CODE>LOGOFF</CODE> command while in a
menu. For further assistance, see your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>DISMNTFAIL</STRONG> The host returned an error when
attempting to dismount your tape. The host message given with this key
should explain the error. Interpret the host message and act
accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>DIVZERO</STRONG> An arithmetic expression included a
division with a zero in the denominator. Determine why a zero is in
the denominator and correct the condition. <P>

<STRONG>DUBINTNAME</STRONG> There are two internal procs with the same
name. Internal procs are identified by <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>,
<CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE>, or <CODE>PARMSET</CODE> commands that have a
value for the <CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter. <P>

<STRONG>DUMMY</STRONG> Should never be displayed. Associated with an
unsupported feature contained in <CODE>tae$tm:action.c</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>DUPPANEL</STRONG> An attempt was made to create a panel with
the same name as an existing panel. Delete the existing panel (using
<CODE>WPT-ERASE</CODE>) or rename the new panel. <P>

<STRONG>DYNBATCH</STRONG> A process attempted to request dynamic
parameters (by calling the <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> subroutine) in batch
mode.  <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> is not allowed in batch mode. A process
that calls <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> may only be run interactively. <P>

<STRONG>DYNINTERN</STRONG> A program attempted to initiate a dynamic
parameter session for an internal proc. TAE does not support requests
for dynamic parameters in internal procs. In the requesting program,
check the name of the file for which dynamic parameters were
requested. <P>

<STRONG>EMPTYASY</STRONG> The user attempted to remove, abort, or
wait on a specific asynchronous job (or all asynchronous jobs) when
the asynchronous job list was empty. <P>

<STRONG>EOFERR</STRONG> An unexpected EOF was encountered while TAE
was reading the symbol table in a compiled PDF. This error message
generally indicates that the compiled PDF was corrupted (or is not, in
fact, a compiled PDF). <P>

<STRONG>ERPROC</STRONG> The command name is incorrectly formatted.
The command name is the first field on a command line (after a
label). Correct the command name. A valid command name is the name of
a TCL intrinsic command or the name of a proc. Type HELP while in TCL
for a list of intrinsic commands and for valid abbreviations of
intrinsic commands. If the command is a proc, a valid name is any
valid file specification on the host. See the TAE system manager or
Appendix A of the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's Manual</CITE>. <P>

<STRONG>EXEPARERR</STRONG> An attempt was made to execute a PAR
file, but the PAR file could not be read. The host-specific reason
for the inability to read the file is indicated in the message. <P>

<STRONG>EXHELP</STRONG> The amount of help information exceeds the
internal capacity of the TAE monitor for an index of page start
locations. You may continue to use the help display, but no PAGE
capability is available. <P>

<STRONG>EXIT</STRONG> This string appears as the value of the
<CODE>$SKEY</CODE> TCL global after dynamic TUTOR session has been
terminated using <CODE>EXIT</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>EXPR</STRONG> The expression used in a <CODE>LET</CODE>,
<CODE>FOR</CODE>, or <CODE>IF</CODE> command does not follow the rules
for the proper format of expressions in TCL. (See the <CITE>TAE
Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for the rules concerning
expressions.) Check for one of the following common problems, and
correct the command accordingly. 1) Missing closing parenthesis. 2) No
characters after an "=". 3) More than one "=". 4) Invalid numeric
(e.g., 1..0e2) 5). Unrecognized operator. <P>

<STRONG>FDSAVAIL</STRONG> This message tells you the number of file
descriptors available for your process. UNIX only. <P>

<STRONG>FLTUTWAIT</STRONG> This is an information message indicating
that TAE is currently busy, reading files and constructing the
necessary data structures for the TUTOR panels. <P>

<STRONG>FMTCOMM</STRONG> This is a TAE internal error. When an
asynchronous job requests dynamic parameters, the data communication
between the asynchronous job and the interactive TAE monitor takes
place in the form of files. In this case, the file sent by the async
job was found to have the incorrect format. <P>

<STRONG>FMTERR</STRONG> A field in the command does not follow the
proper format for that command. This occurs usually when a field has
too many characters in it, or when a closing quotation mark has been
omitted. Check the proper format of the command, by typing <CODE>HELP
<VAR>XXX</VAR></CODE> for help on command <VAR>XXX</VAR>. <P>

<STRONG>FMTRESTR</STRONG> The file used in a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE>
command does not have the proper format, i.e., the file was not
created by the <CODE>SAVE</CODE> command. This message might also
indicate that the file was created by <CODE>SAVE</CODE>, but while
running under a different version of TAE. Parameter files are not
necessarily compatible between different versions of TAE. <P>

<STRONG>FORVARBAD</STRONG> The target variable of a <CODE>FOR</CODE>
statement is not recognizable. The command element following the
characters "<CODE>FOR</CODE>" must be the name of a TCL variable and
is limited to eight or fewer characters. The target variable may not
be indexed.  Correct the proc definition containing the
<CODE>FOR</CODE> statement and re-run.  <P>

<STRONG>FUNUNAV</STRONG> This function is not available until the
invalid value is corrected. Correct the invalid value. <P>

<STRONG>GBLREDEF</STRONG> A mismatch of types occur while attempting
to redefine a global variable. For example, a <CODE>REAL</CODE> value
was targeted for an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> global variable. Check the
type of the global variable. <P>

<STRONG>GETOPIDERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
allocation routine while attempting to get the process identification
number of the owner of the display device you wish to allocate.
Report the error to the VRDI cognizant programmer. <P>

<STRONG>GETERMERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
allocation routine while attempting to get the name of the terminal
you are currently using. Report the error to the VRDI cognizant
programmer. <P>

<STRONG>GETPIDERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
allocation routine while attempting to get your process identification
number. Report the error to the VRDI cognizant programmer. <P>

<STRONG>GETVAXERR</STRONG> A system error occurred in the device
allocation routine while attempting to get the value of the VAX system
symbol. Report the error to the VRDI cognizant programmer. <P>

<STRONG>HIMENNUM</STRONG> The menu selection number is greater than
the highest menu entry shown on the screen. A menu entry selection
must be between 1 and the number of the highest entry shown on the
menu display. Re-enter the selection number; type <CODE>HELP</CODE>
for instructions on running the menu mode of TAE. <P>

<STRONG>HLPRD</STRONG> An I/O error was encountered while reading
the help file. This error occurs after a successful open, and
therefore probably indicates a hardware problem. See the system
manager. <P>

<STRONG>HLPWRT</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while writing the
requested help file. This error occurs after a successful open, and
therefore probably indicates a hardware problem. See the system
manager. <P>

<STRONG>IMSGERR</STRONG> If VAX/VMS: An I/O error occurred while
sending the process initialization message to the process. The message
usually contains initial process parameters. There is a configuration
problem or a host system problem. See the System Manager to check your
quotas and the hardware. If UNIX: The requested process could not be
executed. Use the local system utilities to determine if an
executable image exists for the specified process. Determine if you
have privileges to run that image. If the executable image is named
correctly and you have the proper privileges, then check if there is
a configuration problem or a hardware problem. See the System Manager
to check your quotas and the hardware. <P>

<STRONG>INAPRN</STRONG> Should never be displayed. Referenced by code
in <CODE>tae$tm:misccmd.c</CODE> which, due to conditional
compilation, will never be compiled. <P>

<STRONG>INCOMPAT</STRONG> The definition of a variable received with
a <CODE>RECVAR</CODE> command is incompatible with the definition for the
corresponding variable in the current procedure. Check the
declaration of the variable in the receiving and sending tasks for
matching variable types, and for value vector size and value(s) sent
to be within the range defined in the receiving task. <P>

<STRONG>INCONS</STRONG> You have entered a tape drive specific
command using a symbolic name which is inconsistent with the device
name you have entered. Re-issue the command specifying the names
correctly. Alternatively, specify only the symbolic name OR the
actual device name. <P>

<STRONG>INITXRLIB</STRONG> The TAE monitor could not initialize the Xr
library. Make sure that the X server is running on your system.  If an
Xr error code is given in the accompanying error message, look up the
Xr error code definition in the Xr include file "<CODE>defs.h</CODE>"
and correct the problem if possible. Else, talk to your system
manager.  <P>

<STRONG>INTERR</STRONG> The TAE monitor has failed an internal
integrity check. Report the problem to the TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>INTPDF</STRONG> TAE determined that the requested proc was
an internal proc, but could not re-open the PDF in which the proc is
located. Internal procs may only be invoked from within the PDF that
declares them. If the PDF cannot be re-opened then there may be one of
the following problems: 1) The PDF was inadvertently deleted. 2)
There is insufficient file quota. 3) There is a host system or TAE
internal problem. Verify that the PDF is still in the expected
directory (you can use TUTOR to do this), then see the TAE system
manager. <P>

<STRONG>INUSE</STRONG> The symbolic name you have specified is
currently in use. Re-issue the command using another symbolic name.
<P>

<STRONG>INVALIDPRE</STRONG> The parameter's type is incompatible
with the presentation type specified in the view file. Edit the view
file and reenter the command. <P>

<STRONG>INVBQNAM</STRONG> The name of the batch queue specified in the
<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> qualifier is invalid. The valid batch queue names
are <CODE>NOHUP</CODE> and <CODE>NICE</CODE>. <CODE>NOHUP</CODE> is
the default name. Enter the queue name correctly. <P>

<STRONG>INVDCL</STRONG> The last character on a TCL "<CODE>DCL</CODE>"
command must not be a dash. Remove the dash. If it is necessary to
continue a line, you may use the TCL continuation indicator, "+". <P>

<STRONG>INVHEX</STRONG> A number with an invalid hexadecimal format
was used in a command that expects a hexadecimal number. Correct the
number to make it a valid hex number. Type <CODE>HELP
<VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> for help on the "<VAR>xxx</VAR>" command. <P>

<STRONG>INVIFILE</STRONG> The parameter has type <CODE>FILE</CODE> but
the named file does not match one of the following access rights:
1)The file can be accessed for input. 2) The file can be accessed for
both input and output. Determine through TUTOR or
<CODE>HELP-PARM</CODE> the expected access rights for the file. Using
local system utilities, determine if the file exists and if you have
appropriate rights to read the file. If the parameter is defined to
have <CODE>INOUT</CODE> access, then determine if you have appropriate
rights to write to the file. <P>

<STRONG>INVINT</STRONG> The value for an integer does not conform to
the rules for acceptable integer values. Correct the value to follow
the rules. An acceptable integer is one of the following: 1) A number
without a fraction (e.g., 1001). 2) A number with a zero fraction
(e.g., 2.0). 3) A number with an exponent, but no fraction (e.g., 2e2
or 2.0e2, but not 2e-2 and not 2.2e3). <P>

<STRONG>INVNAME</STRONG> The name of a variable does not follow the
rules for variable naming. Correct the variable name. A valid variable
name contains eight or fewer characters, starts with a letter or
underscore or dollar sign, and may contain any of the following
characters: any number (0-9), any letter (A-Z, a-z), dollar sign ($),
or underscore (_). <P>

<STRONG>INVOUT</STRONG> An output value from a process is not
compatible with the target TCL variable. The candidate value must have
attributes (<CODE>COUNT</CODE>, <CODE>TYPE</CODE>, etc.) that are
consistent with the declaration of the target. Note that, for
parameters of type <CODE>NAME</CODE>, the target variable is the
referenced variable. Determine the name of the variable that was
referenced, and the attributes (<CODE>type</CODE>, <CODE>count</CODE>,
etc.) of that variable. Examine the proc that generated the output to
determine why the value was set incorrectly. <P>

<STRONG>INVPNAME</STRONG> A parameter name has an invalid format.
Correct the parameter name. A valid parameter name consists of eight
or fewer letters or numbers. <P>

<STRONG>INVPVAL</STRONG> The value of a parameter or command qualifier
is incorrectly formatted. Correct the value. A valid value may be
enclosed in quotation marks or unquoted. If unquoted, it should
consist of 134 or fewer characters, and must not contain the
characters ",", ")", "(", a space, or a tab. If the value contains
more than one element, the list of elements should be enclosed within
parentheses. <P>

<STRONG>INVREAL</STRONG> The value for a real variable does not
conform to the rules for acceptable real values. Examples of valid
real numbers are: 81, 100., 478.345, and 456.E-5. Correct the
value. An acceptable real value is any FORTRAN-like <CODE>REAL</CODE>
number acceptable to your host system. <P>

<STRONG>INVSHL</STRONG> The last character on a <CODE>ush</CODE>
command (or other shell entry command) must not be a "\" (the shell
continuation indicator). Use the TCL "+" character for
continuation. <P>

<STRONG>INVSTR</STRONG> The value of a variable does not match any of
the strings in the list of valid strings defined for the variable.  If
the variable is a command parameter, use the TCL command
<CODE>HELP-PARM [<VAR>parameter name</VAR>] [<VAR>command
name</VAR>]</CODE> or the TUTOR command <CODE>HELP [<VAR>parameter
name</VAR>]</CODE> to determine the valid strings for the
parameter. If the variable is a global variable, determine the name of
the proc that defines the global, enter TUTOR for that proc, and use
TUTOR as above to find information on the variable. If the variable is
a local variable defined in a PDF, check the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>
command in the PDF. <P>

<STRONG>INVSUBNAME</STRONG> The name of a variable used in
substitution (i.e., following an "<CODE>&amp;</CODE>") does not follow
the rules for variable naming. Correct the variable name. A valid
variable name contains eight or fewer characters, starts with a letter
or underscore or dollar sign, and may contain any of the following
characters: any number (0-9), any letter (A-Z, a-z), dollar sign ($),
or underscore (_). <P>

<STRONG>INVSUBS</STRONG> The subscript for a variable is either not
an integer or not greater than zero. Determine why the subscript is
not a positive integer; correct the condition. <P>

<STRONG>INVVAL</STRONG> If the variable is a string, then the value of
the variable does not match any of the strings in the list of valid
strings defined for the variable. If the variable is not a string,
then the value of the variable is not in the range (or ranges)
acceptable for the variable. If the variable is a command parameter,
use the TCL command <CODE>HELP-PARM [<VAR>parameter name</VAR>]
[<VAR>command name</VAR>]</CODE> or the TUTOR command <CODE>HELP
[<VAR>parameter name</VAR>]</CODE> to determine the valid values for
the parameter. If the variable is a global variable, determine the
name of the proc that defines the global, enter TUTOR for that proc,
and use TUTOR as above to find information on the variable. If the
variable is a local variable defined in a PDF, check the
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> command in the PDF. <P>

<STRONG>ITRPQUAL</STRONG> In a proc, a parameter is qualified by
setting the <CODE>QUAL</CODE> parameter of the <CODE>PARM</CODE>
declaration to the name of a proc that defines the qualifiers. This
proc must be an internal proc or another PDF; it cannot be an
intrinsic command. Check the name of the referenced qualifier proc. If
it is the name of an existing proc, the proc must be renamed. <P>

<STRONG>JOBOPN</STRONG> While starting a batch or asynchronous job,
TAE encountered a file error opening a JOB file. The JOB file is used
to communicate the job's parameters to the asynchronous or batch TAE
monitor. This error is generally caused by one of the following: 1)
a file quota problem, or 2) a privilege violation (generally
occurring when you run in someone else's account). Interpret the
host-specific error code and confirm that you have access to files in
the current directory. If you do, see the System Manager to determine
if you have sufficient file quota. <P>

<STRONG>JOBREDUN</STRONG> This message is for information only. The
<CODE>JOB</CODE> command qualifier and the second component of the
<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> qualifier may be used to specify an asynchronous
or batch job name. If both are specified, the second component of the
<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> qualifier is ignored. If you have specified the
command qualifiers positionally, check to see that the values you
specified are the ones intended. <P>

<STRONG>JOBWRT</STRONG> TAE encountered a file error writing to a
JOB file. The JOB file is used to communicate the batch or
asynchronous job's parameters to the batch or asynchronous TAE
monitor. This typically indicates a disk error or a disk space quota
problem. Interpret the host-specific error code and confirm that you
have access to files in the current directory. If you do, see the
System Manager to determine if you have sufficient disk space quota.
<P>

<STRONG>KEYCONFLICT</STRONG> The proc definition is incorrect. There
exist one or more keyword parameters that have conflicting (i.e.,
duplicate) keyword values. The proc definition must be corrected. Each
parameter declared <CODE><VAR>TYPE</VAR>=<VAR>KEYWORD</VAR></CODE>
must have a <CODE>VALID</CODE> list of keywords that are unique among
all keyword values in the proc. <P>

<STRONG>KEYSYNTAX</STRONG> The apostrophe character has been
incorrectly used in a command line. Normally, the apostrophe is used
to "flag" keyword values, and every unquoted apostrophe must be
followed by a keyword value. Re-type the command: if the apostrophe
was intended to flag a keyword, correct the command; if the apostrophe
was unintentional, remove the apostrophe. <P>

<STRONG>KEYWORD</STRONG> This error indicates that an invalid or
ambiguous keyword has been used in a command string. The keyword was
flagged with the apostrophe character. The keyword may have been used
for a parameter or for a qualifier. Either the keyword needs to be
correctly spelled or more characters are required to resolve the
ambiguity. The keyword value must be uniquely identified among all of
the keyword values for the proc. <P>

<STRONG>KILLED</STRONG> This is an information message. The process
was terminated because the user typed <CODE>ABORT</CODE> while in
dynamic prompt mode or <CODE>EXIT</CODE> while in dynamic TUTOR. No
action required. <P>

<STRONG>LIBS</STRONG> The length of the library list is greater than
the maximum allowed. Provide fewer libraries in the list. <P>

<STRONG>LOCCONFLICT</STRONG> An attempt has been made to declare a TCL
global variable with the same name as an existing local
variable. Global variables must have names different from any local
variable on the current procedure level. Use <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> to
list the names of all variables, then rename one of the variables in
conflict.  <P>

<STRONG>LOGNULL</STRONG> One of the variables in a logical expression
contained a null value ("<CODE>--</CODE>"). The null value is not
allowed in logical expressions ("<CODE>AND</CODE>", "<CODE>OR</CODE>",
"<CODE>NOT</CODE>"). The variable must be given a non-null value. Note
that if the <CODE>$COUNT</CODE> TCL function returns a 0 for the count
of a variable then the current value is the null value. <P>

<STRONG>LOMENNUM</STRONG> The menu selection number is less than 1.  A
menu entry must be selected that is between 1 and the highest entry
number shown on the menu display.  Re-enter the selection number; type
<CODE>HELP</CODE> for instructions on running the menu mode of
TAE. <P>

<STRONG>LONGCMDLINE</STRONG> The command line is longer than the
maximum allowed line. Note that this may be a result of substitution
(i.e., a string replacing a variable name starting with an
ampersand). If the line overflow is caused by substitution, the
de-referencing technique may remedy the situation. See the <CITE>TAE
Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE>. <P>

<STRONG>LONGINDX</STRONG> The variable name or expression provided for
a variable index in a <CODE>LET</CODE> statement is too long. For
example: <CODE>LET <VAR>var</VAR>(THIS FIELD) = XXX</CODE>. Shorten the
index value length to be shorter than or equal to the number of
characters specified in the error message. <P>

<STRONG>LONGJNAME</STRONG> The user specified asynchronous job name
is longer than the maximum limit allowed by TAE. Check the maximum
allowed length specified in the error message. Resubmit the job with a
shorter name. <P>

<STRONG>LONGJOBFILE</STRONG> Under VAX/VMS, the largest allowable
name for a batch job log file is nineteen characters. Change the file
name. <P>

<STRONG>LONGNAME</STRONG> The variable name on the left side of a
<CODE>LET</CODE> assignment statement is too long. The name of TCL
variables is limited to eight characters. <P>

<STRONG>LONGQNAME</STRONG> Under VAX/VMS, the largest allowable name
for a batch queue is fifteen characters. Change the queue name. <P>

<STRONG>LONGSTR</STRONG> The number of characters in a string is
greater than the defined maximum length of the string. Determine the
maximum length of a string for the specified variable, and correct the
command entry accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>LONGVSTR</STRONG> A variable was declared with a
<CODE>VALID</CODE> string that contained more than 24 characters. Use
a shorter <CODE>VALID</CODE> string. <P>

<STRONG>MALFAIL</STRONG> The MAL (Memory file ALlocate) operation
failed due to a host-specific problem. Interpret the host message and
act accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>MALMDF</STRONG> The specified entry in the menu definition
file has a <CODE>.MENU</CODE> or <CODE>.PROC</CODE> with no associated
menu or proc name.  See the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Manual</CITE> for a description of menu definition files. Correct the
entry in the menu definition file to specify a file name. <P>

<STRONG>MALMSGF</STRONG> Possible causes: 1) There was an I/O error in
reading the help message file. 2) The file of indexes for the message
file does not correspond to the current message file. Use the
<CODE>MSGBLD</CODE> utility to re-build the index file from the
message file. Note for VAX/VMS and UNIX users: the index file has type
<CODE>.INX</CODE>, and the message file has type
<CODE>.MSG</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>MANYTAPES</STRONG> The maximum number of tapes are already
allocated or mounted. Wait until other users have dismounted and
deallocated their tape drives and try again. <P>

<STRONG>MAXDEFC</STRONG> The maximum number of user-defined commands
has already been reached. The <CODE>DEFCMD</CODE> that resulted in the
error message is ignored. $DEFCMD0,
<CODE>$DEFCMD1</CODE>,...,<CODE>$DEFCMD9</CODE> contain the current
list of user-defined commands. Use <CODE>DELCMD</CODE> to delete a
user-defined command. <P>

<STRONG>MAXMEM</STRONG> An attempt was made to allocate more than
the maximum allowed number of memory files. The maximum number of
memory files allowed is controlled by a parameter in TAE. If a larger
number is necessary, see the system programmer about increasing the
ceiling. <P>

<STRONG>MAXMEN</STRONG> The last MENU command or selection of a new
menu entry caused the TAE monitor limit on successive menu references
to be exceeded. Go back to the root menu by typing
<CODE>TOP</CODE>. Note that this condition may be caused by
interspersing menu selection by entry number with menu selection using
the <CODE>MENU</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>MAXNEST</STRONG> The TCL limit on nested constructs was
reached. Correct the procedure commands to eliminate the extra
nesting. <P>

<STRONG>MAXPNEST</STRONG> The maximum number of nested procedure
calls has been reached. This error usually occurs when a procedure
accidently activates itself, and there is no special logic to resolve
the recursion. Correct the procedure's self-reference or reduce the
depth of nesting required by your application. See the TAE system
manager to determine the maximum depth available on your system. <P>

<STRONG>MAXREDEF</STRONG> The <CODE>LOCAL-REDEF</CODE> command does
not support lists of variables. <P>

<STRONG>MDFOPEN</STRONG> The requested menu is not available. This is
generally because of one of the following: 1) incorrect spelling of
the menu name, 2) the menu does not exist in the specified library, or
3) you do not have appropriate access rights to read the menu.
Determine which of the conditions above is the cause of the
problem. If the menu does not exist or you do not have appropriate
access rights, or there is some other cause, see the TAE system
manager. <P>

<STRONG>MEMEXIST</STRONG> The memory file requested has already been
allocated. Only one memory file may be allocated with a given name at
a time. Avoid double allocations. If a memory file size needs to be
changed, use the <CODE>DAL</CODE> command to delete it, and then use
<CODE>MAL</CODE> to create a new one. <P>

<STRONG>MEMOVR</STRONG> The TAE monitor does not have sufficient
internal memory to handle the current command in addition to the
memory already in use as a result of previous commands. Attempt to
reduce the memory required. The major user-controllable uses of the
TAE Monitor internal memory store are: 1) Each variable (including
parameters, local variables, and global variables) requires storage
for the variable characteristics and values. 2) Each nested invocation
of a proc requires storage for proc context. 3) Each nested invocation
of a menu requires storage for menu context. 4) Each
<CODE>DEFCMD</CODE> requires storage for the command definition. 5)
Each library added to the search list adds storage for the list. <P>

<STRONG>MISEQ</STRONG> A command line using the <CODE>FOR</CODE> or
<CODE>LET</CODE> command did not follow the proper format for these
commands. Type <CODE>HELP FOR</CODE> or <CODE>HELP LET</CODE>, and
correct the command line according to the help information
displayed. <P>

<STRONG>MISINTRO</STRONG> All proc definition files in TCL must start
with one of <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE>, <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>,
<CODE>GLOBAL</CODE>, or <CODE>PARMSET</CODE>, depending on the type of
proc. Insert the necessary introductory command. Type <CODE>HELP
<VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> to display information on the "<VAR>xxx</VAR>"
command. <P>

<STRONG>MISMATCH</STRONG> A target variable of a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE>
operation does not have the proper definition for the corresponding
variable in the parameter file. For example, a <CODE>REAL</CODE>
variable in a parameter file was targeted for an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>
variable, or a "valid" list changed after the variable was
<CODE>SAVE</CODE>d. Check for correct file name if you are restoring
explicitly by using the <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>MISPAR</STRONG> The specified command requires that the listed
parameters be entered on the command line. Re-issue the command with
values for the missing parameters. If you are unsure of the proper
values for this command, Type <CODE>TUTOR <VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> to
TUTOR for the values for command "<VAR>xxx</VAR>", or type
<CODE>HELP-PARM <VAR>yyy xxx</VAR></CODE> to display information on
the "<VAR>yyy</VAR>" parameter of the "<VAR>xxx</VAR>" command. <P>

<STRONG>MISPROC</STRONG> A help request was given without a proc
specified. This may occur if, in a <CODE>help-parm</CODE> or
<CODE>help-global</CODE> request, a subcommand was given with no
command. <P>

<STRONG>MISSLIB</STRONG> The specified library is not on the current
library list. No action required. Use <CODE>SHOW</CODE> to display the
current library search list. <P>

<STRONG>MISWINPARM</STRONG> Should never be displayed. Associated with
an unsupported feature contained in <CODE>tae$tm:action.c</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>MIXTYPE</STRONG> The type of a variable used on the left side
in a <CODE>LET</CODE> or <CODE>FOR</CODE> command does not match the
type of a variable or constant used on the right-hand side. All
variables and constants used in <CODE>LET</CODE> and <CODE>FOR</CODE>
commands must have the same type. For example, if a user types
<CODE>LET II = 1.2</CODE> then <CODE>II</CODE> should be a
<CODE>REAL</CODE> variable. The TCL data types are
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and
<CODE>FILE</CODE>; see the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Manual</CITE> for the rules on allowable values for each data
type. Correct the command to use matching types. <P>

<STRONG>MIXVAR</STRONG> More than one data type is used on the right
side of a <CODE>LET</CODE> or <CODE>FOR</CODE> command, or the type of
a variable or constant used on the left side in a <CODE>LET</CODE> or
<CODE>FOR</CODE> command does not match the type of a variable or
constant used on the right-hand side. All variables and constants used
in <CODE>LET</CODE> and <CODE>FOR</CODE> commands must have the same
type.  For example, if a user types <CODE>LET II = J + 1.2</CODE> then
<CODE>II</CODE> and <CODE>J</CODE> should be <CODE>REAL</CODE>
variables. The TCL data types are <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>,
<CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and <CODE>FILE</CODE>; see the
<CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for the rules on
allowable values for each data type. Correct the command to use
matching types. <P>

<STRONG>MNTABORT</STRONG> A mount request was aborted during
execution. The abort could have been a <CODE>control-C</CODE> typed by
the user, an operator abort, or a situation with which the
<CODE>MOUNT</CODE> command does not know how to deal. The message
given should be self explanatory. If it is unclear, consult the system
programmer. <P>

<STRONG>MOUNTED</STRONG> You have attempted to mount or deallocate a
tape drive which is currently mounted. If you are attempting to
mount, use another tape drive or wait until the current user of this
drive has dismounted and deallocated. If you are attempting to
deallocate, dismount the tape first. <P>

<STRONG>MSGHANDS</STRONG> When an executing process sends a message
to the TAE monitor (via the <CODE>XMPUT</CODE> subroutine call), TM sends a
handshake message back to the process acknowledging the reception of
the original message. The process is unable to receive this handshake
message. This is an internal error. <P>

<STRONG>MULVAR</STRONG> The only operation supported for multivalued
expressions is assignment. Only scalars may be used in arithmetic,
string, or logical expressions. Use subscripts to apply the
operations to the individual components of the vector. <P>

<STRONG>NAMERR</STRONG> <CODE>VALID</CODE>, <CODE>ACCESS</CODE>, and
<CODE>COUNT</CODE> do not apply for <CODE>TYPE=NAME</CODE>. In
performing checks on data assignments to variables with type
<CODE>NAME</CODE>, the TAE monitor uses the <CODE>VALID</CODE>,
<CODE>ACCESS</CODE>, <CODE>TYPE</CODE>, and <CODE>COUNT</CODE> of the
ultimately referenced variable. Remove the <CODE>VALID</CODE>, or
<CODE>ACCESS</CODE>, or <CODE>COUNT</CODE> clause from the command
line. <P>

<STRONG>NESTMUL</STRONG> TCL does not support the placement of a
parenthesized list embedded within another parenthesized list. For
example, the following is not legal: <CODE>LET I = (1, 2, (2, 3)
)</CODE> Determine the cause of the nested parenthesized lists; remove
the inner parentheses or correct the commands that generated the
lists. <P>

<STRONG>NOABO</STRONG> The specific asynchronous job could not be
aborted because it is no longer active. This means the job either has
run to completion, or has already been aborted by the user. This
message is also generated in response to a <CODE>REMOVE</CODE> command
for a specific or all asynchronous jobs, showing the name of the
active job(s) that are not removed from the async job list. User
action: 1) None, if the job to be aborted is already complete. 2)
None, if you have used the <CODE>REMOVE ALL</CODE> command. 3) Else,
(in case of <CODE>REMOVE <VAR>job name</VAR></CODE>) wait until the
job is completed, and then reissue the command. (You may abort the job
if you do not want to wait until it completes.) <P>

<STRONG>NOASYROOM</STRONG> The TAE monitor maintains housekeeping
information for up to 100 asynchronous jobs. If you submit more than
100 jobs without removing completed jobs from the list, TM tries to
remove the first inactive job from the list to make room for the new
job. However, if all the jobs in the list are active, the new job
cannot be run asynchronously. Wait until at least one active job is
complete. You may check that by typing the <CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>
command. Then resubmit your job. <P>

<STRONG>NOAVLGDEV</STRONG> An attempt was made to allocate
(<CODE>USE</CODE>) a display device using a generic device name and no
such device is available to be allocated. Do a <CODE>SHOWDISP</CODE>
to determine which devices are available to be allocated and
<CODE>USE</CODE> one of them. <P>

<STRONG>NOBATCH</STRONG> The submission of the batch job to the
local operating system was rejected. Use the documentation on the
local operating system to interpret the error code. See the TAE system
manager for further action. <P>

<STRONG>NOBCHSTA</STRONG> Under VAX/VMS, the batch job status is
read from a VMS mailbox; an I/O error was encountered while reading
from this mailbox. Use the documentation on the local operating
system to interpret the error code. See the TAE system manager for
further action. <P>

<STRONG>NOCOLOR</STRONG> In a <CODE>WINDOW-DRAW</CODE> operation, a
color was requested that does not exist. Run the
<CODE>fontbrowse</CODE> proc to determine the available colors on your
system. <P>

<STRONG>NOCOMM</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while the process was
sending a message containing parameters to the TAE monitor. Report
the problem to the TAE system manager. For VAX/VMS users: the I/O
error occurred while writing to a mailbox. The error code is shown on
the message line. <P>

<STRONG>NOCOMMAND</STRONG> This command has been implemented on some
TAE versions, but not the version you are using. <P>

<STRONG>NODEFDEV</STRONG> An attempt was made to allocate
(<CODE>USE</CODE>) a display device using the default device option
and the terminal used does not have a default device assigned to
it. Do a <CODE>SHOWDISP</CODE> to determine which devices are
available to be allocated and <CODE>USE</CODE> one of them. <P>

<STRONG>NODEVID</STRONG> You have issued a tape drive specific
command without specifying a drive. Re-issue the command, specifying
the drive or request <CODE>HELP</CODE> on the command. <P>

<STRONG>NODISABLE</STRONG> A path cannot be disabled while a job is
active. Abort the current job, or wait for it to terminate. To show
the status of all jobs, use <CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>; to abort a job, use
<CODE>ABORT-ASYNC</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NODYNPDF</STRONG> The name of a PDF to be used for dynamic
tutoring was not found where expected. This is an indication of a
problem in the TAE software. <P>

<STRONG>NOENABLE</STRONG> There was a request to receive variables
from another task at a path which has not been established. Establish
a path with the <CODE>ENABLE-RECVAR</CODE> TCL command before
requesting to receive messages. Find an explanation for the host error
code printed with the error message. If you cannot correct the
problem, see your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>NOFAC</STRONG> Either the message index file for the specified
facility cannot be found or opened, or the message file itself cannot
be found or opened. (The "facility" is the string of characters before
the dash in the message key.) See the TAE system manager. Note for
VAX/VMS and UNIX users: the index file has type <CODE>.INX</CODE>, and
the message file has type <CODE>.MSG</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOFILE</STRONG> The specified message file could not be
found. Check your typing against the intended name. Note that the
default type is "msg". <P>

<STRONG>NOFONT</STRONG> The specified font does not exist on this
system. The TAE utility proc fontbrowse can be used to display the
available fonts on your system. <P>

<STRONG>NOGBLRES</STRONG> This message indicates that the disk file
referenced on a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command does not contain any
global variables. This is a information message and may not
necessarily indicate that an error condition exists. The message may
be avoided by using the <CODE>RESTORE-LOCALS</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>NOGLB</STRONG> The user requested help on a TCL global
variable that does not exist. Check the name of the global
variable. You may display the existing globals by using the
<CODE>DISPLAY-GLOBAL</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>NOHELP</STRONG> There is no help information on the named
command or menu. See the TAE system manager or the author of the menu
or command. <P>

<STRONG>NOJOB</STRONG> The user specified asynchronous job is not in
the async job list. Either the job was never submitted for
asynchronous execution, or the job has already been removed from the
list. Check the job name, and if the name was misspelled, re-enter
the command with the correct name. You may display the async job list
using <CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOKEY</STRONG> There is no help information on the specified
messagekey in the message file for the specified facility. (The
"facility" is the string of characters before the dash in the message
key.) See the TAE system manager or the author of the message file.
<P>

<STRONG>NOLETVAL</STRONG> A <CODE>LET</CODE> command must have a value
on the right hand side. Correct the <CODE>LET</CODE> command to have
an appropriate value. <P>

<STRONG>NOLOCRES </STRONG> This message indicates that the disk file
referenced on a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command does not contain any
local variables. This is a warning message and may not necessarily
indicate that an error condition exists. The message may be avoided by
using the <CODE>RESTORE-GLOBALS</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>NOMEMFIL</STRONG> An attempt was made to delete a memory file
which is not currently allocated. No action is required. If the memory
file does not exist, it does not need to be deleted. In addition, all
memory files are automatically deleted upon exiting TAE. <P>

<STRONG>NOMODHELP</STRONG> No help is available on this mode of
TAE. See your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>NOMOUNT</STRONG> The host returned an error when attempting
to mount your tape. The host message given with this key should
explain the error. Interpret the host message and act accordingly.
<P>

<STRONG>NOMSG</STRONG> The message key is missing from the
<CODE>HELP-MESSAGE</CODE> command. The <CODE>HELP-MESSAGE</CODE>
command requires a key. For example: <CODE>HELP-MESSAGE
TAE-HELLO</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>NONAME</STRONG> A proc contains another proc, but the
contained ("internal") proc does not have a
name. <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>, <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE>, and
<CODE>PARMSET</CODE> commands that are internal to another proc must
be identified by a value for the <CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter. If an
internal proc is desired, name it using a value for the
<CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language
Programmer's Manual</CITE> for details on internal procs. <P>

<STRONG>NONE</STRONG> This string appears as the value of the
<CODE>$SKEY</CODE> TCL global after a listing command has been issued
that results in no entries listed. <P>

<STRONG>NONGBL</STRONG> A global variable may be deleted only by using
the <CODE>DELETE-GLOBALS</CODE> command with the name of a
<CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> proc that defines the variables, or using
<CODE>DELETE-VAR</CODE>. Determine the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> proc that
defined the variable to be deleted, and use <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
accordingly.  For more information on <CODE>DELETE</CODE> type
<CODE>HELP DELETE</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOOWNGDEV</STRONG> An attempt was made to deallocate
(<CODE>FREE</CODE>) a display device using a generic device name and
no such device had been allocated. Do a <CODE>SHOWDISP</CODE> to
determine which device is currently allocated to you and
<CODE>FREE</CODE> it. <P>

<STRONG>NOPANEL</STRONG> In a WPT operation, the named panel does not
exist. Review your TCL code that created the panels. The panel name is
in the TCL variable <CODE><VAR>VIEW._panel.name</VAR></CODE>, where
<CODE>VIEW</CODE> is the view variable through which the panel
attributes are set. <P>

<STRONG>NOPARENS</STRONG> Parentheses are required around logical
expressions. Example: <CODE>IF (s = "myfile" AND t =
"yourfile")...</CODE> Insert the necessary parentheses around the
logical expression. <P>

<STRONG>NOPARHELP</STRONG> No help information exists on the specified
parameter in the help file for the specified proc. See the TAE system
manager or the author of the proc. Note that you may type <CODE>TUTOR
<VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> to be tutored for the parameter values on
command "<VAR>xxx</VAR>".  <P>

<STRONG>NOPARM</STRONG> The specified command is to be typed using
only the command name. There are no parameters. Retype the command
name alone. <P>

<STRONG>NOPARMRES</STRONG> The user requested that TAE restore all
the parameters from a saved file in which there are no
parameters. Check the file name for correctness. <P>

<STRONG>NOPDFPARM</STRONG> This is an information message. The
specified PDF does not have any parameters. No action required. <P>

<STRONG>NOPRMNM</STRONG> You have not specified which parameter you
want help on. Re-issue the command, specifying the parameter name.
<P>

<STRONG>NOPROC</STRONG> The first word on the command line is expected
to be a command name. If it is not a TCL intrinsic command, then TAE
searches for the name in the proc libraries. If a proc search was
intended, then use the <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command to display the
current search list. Also the <CODE>PROCS</CODE> utility in the
utilities library may be used to display the names of available
procs. <P>

<STRONG>NOQUAL</STRONG> Command qualifiers are not defined for TCL
intrinsic commands. Qualifiers are special parameters enclosed in
vertical bars, for example: <CODE><VAR>command</VAR>|RUNTYPE=BATCH,
RESTORE=<VAR>file</VAR>|</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>NOSUB</STRONG> <CODE>SUBCMD/END-SUB</CODE> are proper brackets
for parameters associated with a subcommand. This error message also
appears when subcommands are nested. Insert <CODE>SUBCMD</CODE> at the
appropriate location in the procedure or delete the
<CODE>END-SUB</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOSUBC</STRONG> No subcommand has been selected. Select a
subcommand then select the <CODE>DO</CODE> button. <P>

<STRONG>NOSUBHELP</STRONG> No help text is defined in the PDF or
help file for the associated specified sub-command. See the author of
the proc. <P>

<STRONG>NOSUCHDEV</STRONG> An attempt was made to allocate
(<CODE>USE</CODE>) a display device unknown to the system. Do a
<CODE>SHOWDISP</CODE> to determine which devices are available to be
allocated and <CODE>USE</CODE> one of them. <P>

<STRONG>NOSYMNAM</STRONG> You have entered the <CODE>MOUNT</CODE>
command without specifying a symbolic name for the tape drive. Since
you did not allocate the drive, both the symbolic name and the actual
device name are required. Re-issue the <CODE>MOUNT</CODE> command,
specifying both the symbolic name and the actual device name. An
alternative is to allocate the drive first. <P>

<STRONG>NOSYNC</STRONG> In proc interrupt mode - the mode TAE enters
after the attention sequence is typed - a user may type most TCL
intrinsic commands, or initiate an asynchronous or batch proc. A user
may not invoke a proc in proc interrupt mode unless the proc is to be
run asynchronously (<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> qualifier set to
<CODE>ASYNC</CODE>) or in batch (<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> set to
<CODE>BATCH</CODE>). <P>

<STRONG>NOTALLOC</STRONG> You have attempted to deallocate a tape
drive which is not currently allocated. Re-issue the command,
correctly specifying the symbolic or actual device name of the drive
you wish to deallocate. <P>

<STRONG>NOTARGET</STRONG> The variable for the "target" qualifier set
required for creating the panel does not exist. Correct your TCL code
to refer to the appropriate variable. (See the <CODE>WPT</CODE>
command in the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Guide</CITE> for
more information on using <CODE>WPT-PANEL</CODE>.) <P>

<STRONG>NOTASYNCMD</STRONG> An asynchronous proc is trying to execute
a TCL intrinsic command that is not available from asynchronous
jobs. An example is the <CODE>ENABLE-LOG</CODE> command. Delete the
command from the proc, or run the proc interactively. <P>

<STRONG>NOTAVAIL</STRONG> VMS was unable to allocate the drive you
requested. Interpret the host message given and act accordingly. If
the problem is not obvious, consult VMS manuals or see your System
Manager. <P>

<STRONG>NOTBATCHCMD</STRONG> The specified command is available only
if you are running in an interactive session. See the <CITE>TAE
Command Language User's Manual</CITE> for the list of commands not
allowed in batch.  Eliminate the command from the procedure. Note that
a procedure may "adapt" to its environment as follows:

<PRE>
	IF ($RUNTYPE = "INTERACTIVE")
	    <VAR>commands-restricted-to-interactive-sessions</VAR>
	END-IF
</PRE>

<STRONG>NOTDEALL</STRONG> The host returned an error when attempting
to deallocate a device. The host message given with this key should
explain the error. Interpret the host message and act accordingly.
<P>

<STRONG>NOTEXT</STRONG> The help file exists for the requested
information but there is no text following the <CODE>.HELP</CODE>
directive. See the author of the proc or the TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>NOTFND</STRONG> No parameter or subcommand name was found
matching the string specified. This message is also displayed when the
only occurrence of the string is the current parameter or subcommand.
Specify another string for which to search. <P>

<STRONG>NOTINBODY</STRONG> The specified command is allowed only in
the declaration section of the PDF. Either eliminate the command or
place it in the declaration section. <P>

<STRONG>NOTINPDF</STRONG> The specified command is allowed only at
the interactive level. Remove the command from the PDF. <P>

<STRONG>NOTINPRE</STRONG> The specified command is allowed only after
the <CODE>BODY</CODE> command of a procedure. Move the command to
follow <CODE>BODY</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOTMOUNT</STRONG> You have issued a <CODE>DISMOUNT</CODE>
command for a tape drive which is not currently mounted. Re-issue the
command using the correct symbolic name or actual device name. <P>

<STRONG>NOTMOUNTED</STRONG> You are attempting to access a file on a
tape which is not mounted. Make sure the tape is properly mounted,
then re-issue the command. <P>

<STRONG>NOTNAME</STRONG> The argument to a <CODE>$COUNT</CODE> or a
<CODE>$GLOBAL</CODE> function is not a variable name. For example:
<CODE>LET I = $COUNT(1)</CODE>, or <CODE>LET J =
$GLOBAL(123)</CODE>. Here the arguments 1 and 123 are numbers rather
than names. If the variable name is misspelled, type it correctly.
<P>

<STRONG>NOTNULL</STRONG> An attempt was made to assign the null value
to a parameter, but the definition of the parameter does not permit
the null value. The null value is indicated by two adjacent dashes,
i.e., "<CODE>--</CODE>". The "<CODE>--</CODE>" must be replaced by a
valid value. You can learn more about the specific parameter by
entering TUTOR mode and requesting help on the parameter. If you are
already in TUTOR, type <CODE>HELP parm</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>NOTSTR</STRONG> The argument to the <CODE>$STRLEN</CODE>
function must be a string. Correct the <CODE>$STRLEN</CODE>
argument. <P>

<STRONG>NOTUSED</STRONG> This error indicates a problem in one of the
following areas: 1) A process has malfunctioned. The process has
called the <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> subroutine with a V-block that contains
one or more TCL variables that are not defined in PDF identified by
the <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> call. 2) The parameter file specified by a
<CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command qualifier contains some parameters that
do not apply to the command.  This is not necessarily an error
condition; the parameters that are known to the PDF have been properly
retrieved. <P>

<STRONG>NOVALID</STRONG> A parameter with type <CODE>NAME</CODE> was
declared with a <CODE>VALID</CODE> list. Remove the <CODE>VALID</CODE>
list from the <CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter.  (<CODE>VALID</CODE> lists
may be included in the declaration of the variable referenced through
the <CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter, but not associated with the
<CODE>NAME</CODE> parameter itself.) <P>

<STRONG>NOVAL</STRONG> A command referenced a variable that has never
been assigned a value. A variable may be declared without any
value. The variable must have a value in order to participate in the
expression. A variable may be assigned a value with the
<CODE>LET</CODE> command, for example: <CODE>LET <VAR>STRING</VAR> =
"hello"</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>NOVALUE</STRONG> An attempt to substitute for a TCL
variable was made and the variable currently has no
value. (Substitution is indicated by the ampersand character.) If the
command line was typed interactively, re-type the command, requesting
substitution only for variables which have values. If the error
occurred in a proc, then the proc definition is incorrect and must be
corrected. <P>

<STRONG>NOVAR</STRONG> The user requested that TAE restore the
value(s) of a global, local, or parameter variable that does not exist
in the specified parameter file. Check the variable name and the saved
file name for correctness. The <CODE>DISPLAY-PARFILE</CODE> command
may be used to display the variable names in the parameter file. <P>

<STRONG>NOVIEW</STRONG> The variable for the <CODE>view</CODE>
qualifier set required for creating the panel does not exist. Correct
your TCL code to refer to the appropriate variable. (See the
<CODE>WPT</CODE> command in the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Guide</CITE> for more information on using <CODE>WPT-PANEL</CODE>.) <P>

<STRONG>NOWAIT</STRONG> The user issued a reply command with no job
name when there are no asynchronous jobs waiting for dynamic
parameters, or a reply command is issued for a specific job which is
not waiting. Check the asynchronous job status by typing
<CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>. In case of a misspelled job name, re-enter
the original command with the correct name. <P>

<STRONG>NOWAIT</STRONG> You cannot wait on an asynchronous job that is
itself waiting for dynamic parameters from the user. If you type
<CODE>WAIT-ASYNC <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>, to wait on job
<VAR>name</VAR> (or <CODE>ALL</CODE>), TAE displays the name(s) of the
job(s) that are waiting for dynamic parameters. <P>

<STRONG>NOWINDOW</STRONG> In a <CODE>WINDOW</CODE> operation, a window
that does not exist was named. Use <CODE>WINDOW-INFO</CODE> to
determine the names of windows currently displayed. <P>

<STRONG>NOWRITE</STRONG> You specified the <CODE>'INIT</CODE> keyword
on the mount command, but did not specify <CODE>'WRITE</CODE>. The
tape must be writeable in order to be initialized. Re-issue the
command with the <CODE>'WRITE</CODE> keyword. <P>

<STRONG>NOWRTRNG</STRONG> This is an informational message only. A
tape was mounted with <CODE>PROTECT=WRITE</CODE> but no write ring, so
the tape is being dismounted and the operator is forced to put a write
ring on the tape or abort the job. No action needed. <P>

<STRONG>NOXINIT</STRONG> The X Window System has not been
initialized. <CODE>WPT-INIT</CODE> initializes the X Window
System. <P>

<STRONG>NOXLIB</STRONG> TAE was not installed on your system with X
Windows support. If X Windows is available on your system, check with
your system manager about re-installing TAE with X Windows support.
<P>

<STRONG>NULLARG</STRONG> A null argument - a variable with the "null"
value - was passed to a TCL function that does not support null
arguments. Determine why the argument was null and correct the
problem. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for
an explanation of TCL functions and null arguments. <P>

<STRONG>NULLELEM</STRONG> The null value syntax ("<CODE>--</CODE>")
appeared as a list element of a multi-value list. The null value is
not acceptable as a component of another value. Individual components
of a variable may not be nulled; only the variable itself may be
nulled. <P>

<STRONG>NULLLIST</STRONG> This is an information message. A proc is
requesting dynamic parameter input but has provided no list of
parameters against which to request information. No action is
required. The proc continues execution. <CODE>UNRPSCMD</CODE> The
command is not a recognized prompt style command. Re-issue the command
or type <CODE>HELP</CODE>.  <P>

<STRONG>NUMPARM</STRONG> The specified command is defined to use only
the number of parameters shown. Type <CODE>HELP
<VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE> to determine the format of the
command. <P>

<STRONG>NUMNULL</STRONG> One of the variables in a numeric expression
contained a null value ("<CODE>--</CODE>"). The null value is not
allowed in numeric expressions ("+","-","/","*"). The variable must be
given a non-null value. Note that if the <CODE>$COUNT</CODE> TCL
function returns a 0 for the count of a variable then the current
value is the null value. <P>

<STRONG>OLDPARFILE</STRONG> The parameter file you tried to read has
an obsolete format. You must convert the file in order to use it.
Type <CODE>HELP CONVERT</CODE> or <CODE>TUTOR CONVERT</CODE> for
information on how to convert old files. <P>

<STRONG>OLDRESFILE</STRONG> The resource file you tried to read has an
obsolete format. You must convert the file in order to use it.  Type
<CODE>HELP CONVERT</CODE> or <CODE>TUTOR CONVERT</CODE> for
information on how to convert old files. <P>

<STRONG>ONFAIL</STRONG> Two possible causes: 1) The command string
that was assigned in a procedure to the <CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> variable
has a command format that cannot be interpreted by the TAE monitor. 2)
The <CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> variable has been assigned a command that is
not allowed for <CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE>. The only commands allowed for
<CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> are <CODE>GOTO</CODE>, <CODE>CONTINUE</CODE>,
<CODE>RETURN</CODE>, <CODE>BREAK</CODE>, <CODE>NEXT</CODE>, or
<CODE>STOP</CODE>. Correct the <CODE>_ONFAIL</CODE> assignment. <P>

<STRONG>OPNRD</STRONG> The command you issued cannot open the file
you specified on the command line. The file does not exist, or the
file is protected against read access, or the file specification is
incorrect. (Note that there is no hierarchy search for scripts or
parameter files; if the file is not located in the default library,
you must name the library explicitly.) Use the local operating system
I/O error code listed in the error message to determine the source of
the error. See the documentation on the operating system or the System
Manager for further action. Use local system utilities to check if
the file exists and to check if you have appropriate privileges to
read the file. If the problem is not then evident, see the System
Manager. <P>

<STRONG>OPNWRT</STRONG> The command you issued cannot open the file
you specified on the command line. The error is usually related to one
of the following: 1) The file specification has incorrect syntax. 2)
The explicit directory is protected from access. 3) The default
directory is protected from access. Use local system utilities to
check if you have the appropriate privileges to write to the
file. (If, under VAX/VMS, you have used the DCL command, <CODE>SET
DEFAULT</CODE>, to change to another user's directory, you may not
have the appropriate privileges.) Use the local operating system I/O
error code listed in the error message to determine the source of the
error. See the documentation on the operating system or the System
Manager for further action. <P>

<STRONG>OVER</STRONG> An application program has malfunctioned. The
file name being received by a call to <CODE>XRFILE</CODE> is longer
than the declaration of the character variable designated to receive
the name.  The program has been terminated at the point of the
<CODE>XRFILE</CODE> call. <P>

<STRONG>PAGENUM</STRONG> A negative or zero page number was typed or
the page number was a string. Re-issue the command with the desired
page number. <P>

<STRONG>PARBLK</STRONG> TAE has received a data block from a process
and the block is incorrectly formatted. This usually means that the
program has called the <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE> subroutine or the
<CODE>XQOUT</CODE> subroutine with a V-block that is improperly
formatted. This can be caused by one or more of the following: 1) The
V-block was properly constructed but has been destroyed at some point
before the <CODE>XQ</CODE> call.  2) The V-block was not properly
constructed using the XQ subroutines. A typical sequence of V-block
construction is: <CODE>XQINI</CODE>, <CODE>XQINTG</CODE>,
<CODE>XQREAL</CODE>, and <CODE>XQSTR</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>PAROPN</STRONG> A new PAR file could not be created because
of a failure in the open operation. More specific information on the
cause of the error is given in the message. The most likely cause is
an attempt to write into a directory for which the user does not have
"write" access. Another possible cause is an error in typing the file
specification. <P>

<STRONG>PARS</STRONG> There are fewer parameters defined for the
specified command than are given on the command line, or too many
command or parameter qualifiers are specified. Re-issue the command
with the correct number of parameter values or qualifiers. If you do
not know the correct number, type <CODE>TUTOR <VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> to
be tutored for the parameters of command "<VAR>xxx</VAR>", or type

<STRONG>PARSIZE</STRONG> The structure used to send information for
dynamic tutoring (the "parblk" structure) is not large enough to
handle all the variables requested. <P>

<STRONG>PATH</STRONG> The requested path cannot be established.
Find an explanation for the host error code printed with the error
message. If you cannot correct the problem, see your System Manager.
<P>

<STRONG>PDFRD</STRONG> The proc definition file has been found but
cannot be opened. This is usually caused by a file protection error.
Use host system utilities to check the integrity of the proc file
(that is, determine if the file can be read by host system
utilities). See the TAE system manager for further help. <P>

<STRONG>PFOPN</STRONG> This condition is a result of a problem
associated with the executable code of a process or the file
configuration. The file specified in an <CODE>XRRDB</CODE> call could
not be opened. Use the error code shown in the message to determine
why the file could not be opened. Correct the file configuration or
the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>PFRD</STRONG> This condition is a result of a problem in the
executable code of a process or the file configuration. An I/O error
occurred while reading the specified parameter file from the process
(in an <CODE>XRRDB</CODE> call). Use the error code given in the
message to determine the cause of the error. Correct the file
configuration or the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>PFWRT</STRONG> This condition is a result of a problem in the
executable code of a process or the file configuration. An I/O error
occurred while writing to the specified parameter file from the
process (in an <CODE>XQWRTB</CODE> call). Use the error code given in
the message to determine the cause of the error. Correct the file
configuration or the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>POSERR</STRONG> The format of a proc invocation command line
requires that values specified by position precede values specified by
name for command parameters, and for command or parameter qualifiers.
Example: <CODE>CMD 1, 2, 3, P4=4, P5=5</CODE>. In this example, the
first three values are specified by position, and the last two by
name. <P>

<STRONG>PRCDONLY</STRONG> The TCL command you typed is allowed only in
TAE procedures. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's
Manual</CITE> for a list of commands available to a terminal user. <P>

<STRONG>PRCSABT</STRONG> A system error was encountered when trying
to abort a process. There is a configuration problem or a host system
problem. See the System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>PRCSACT</STRONG> The program associated with the proc cannot
be found on disk. If the <CODE>EXECUTE=</CODE> specification is
omitted from the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> statement for the proc, then the
program name is assumed to be in the same library as the proc. If the
<CODE>EXECUTE=</CODE> specification is present, then the file name
cannot be accessed; either the file does not exist or the the file is
protected from access. Correct the proc definition or create the
program file.  <P>

<STRONG>PRCSCOM</STRONG> On UNIX systems, the terminal monitor could
not establish communication with the application process. This may
happen if the terminal monitor exceeds the open file quota limit or
if there is a hardware problem. See the TAE system manager to check
your quotas and the hardware. <P>

<STRONG>PRCSINI</STRONG> If VAX/VMS: The requested process cannot be
initiated. Use the local system utilities to determine if an
executable image exists for the specified process. Determine if you
have privileges to run that image. If the executable image is named
correctly and you have the proper privileges, then check whether there
is a configuration problem or a hardware problem. See the System
Manager. If UNIX: Under the UNIX operating system, the TAE monitor
first creates a child process to run an application program. This
creation has failed. This problem may be caused by exceeding the
maximum number of processes allowed in the system. Restart TAE and
report the problem to the TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>PRCSTRM</STRONG> This is an information message. The
executed process returned an "abnormal" status. <P>

<STRONG>PREEOF</STRONG> An end-of-file was read in a proc definition
file before the <CODE>END-PROC</CODE> command was encountered. Place
an <CODE>END-PROC</CODE> at the end of the proc definition file (or,
if there is help information, before the help information). <P>

<STRONG>PRMRCV</STRONG> This condition is a result of a problem
associated with the executable code of the process or the environment
in which the user is running. The call to <CODE>XRINIM</CODE>
failed. Use the code shown on the message line to determine the cause
of the problem. Correct the program or the user's environment
accordingly.  <P>

<STRONG>PRMSIZ</STRONG> This condition is a result of a problem in the
executable code for the process. A call to <CODE>XRINIM</CODE> or
<CODE>XRRDB</CODE> failed because the <CODE>DIM</CODE> argument is not
large enough to receive the variable values. Determine the appropriate
size for <CODE>DIM</CODE> and correct the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>PROCONLY</STRONG> The specified command is not available for
interactive use. Place the command in a procedure, or use a different
command. Type <CODE>HELP <VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> for more information on
command "<VAR>xxx</VAR>". <P>

<STRONG>PROCSYN</STRONG> The name of the proc to be invoked does not
follow the TAE rules for proc names. Correct the name. The rules for
correct proc names are given in the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's
Manual</CITE>. (If the proc name you have given is a host file spec,
see the appendix A to that manual.) <P>

<STRONG>PSETOVER</STRONG> The internal memory store reserved by the
TAE monitor for process parameter values is not large enough to
accommodate the current values. Reduce one or more of the following:
1) the number of values per parameter, 2) the number of parameters, or
3) the number of characters in string parameters. <P>

<STRONG>QUALDEL</STRONG> Deleting a qualifier of a variable is not
allowed. <P>

<STRONG>QUALERR</STRONG> The qualifier after the proc name or
parameter is not enclosed within '|' or the format for the qualifiers
do not follow the general parameter list format. Enclose the
qualifiers within '|' or fix the qualifier list. The proper format for
the list is shown in the following example: <CODE>PROC|RESTORE=myfile,
RUNTYPE=BATCH| PAR=3</CODE> which sets the <CODE>RESTORE</CODE>
qualifier to <CODE>myfile</CODE> and the <CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> to
<CODE>BATCH</CODE>. Another example: <CODE>PR1 x|3|</CODE> Here, proc
<CODE>PR1</CODE> sets the parameter qualifier for the <CODE>x</CODE>
parameter to 3. <P>

<STRONG>RANGE</STRONG> The value of the variable is not in the
acceptable range (or ranges) for the variable. If the variable is a
command parameter, use the TCL command <CODE>HELP-PARM [<VAR>parameter
name</VAR>] [<VAR>command name</VAR>]</CODE> or the TUTOR command
<CODE>HELP [<VAR>parameter name</VAR>]</CODE> to determine the valid
range for the parameter. If the variable is a global variable,
determine the name of the proc that defines the global, enter TUTOR
for that proc, and use TUTOR as above to find information on the
variable. If the variable is a local variable defined in a PDF, check
the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> command in the PDF. <P>

<STRONG>RCVERR</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while receiving a
message from a process. The message usually contains process
parameters for dynamic TUTOR. There is a configuration problem or a
host system problem. See the System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>RCVMON</STRONG> The asynchronous job, waiting for dynamic
parameters from the interactive TAE monitor, was unsuccessful in
receiving a reply message. This may happen due to a TAE internal error
or a host system problem. Find an explanation for the host error code
printed with the error message. If you cannot correct the problem, see
your System Manager. <P>

<STRONG>RDEOF</STRONG> During the second phase of a PDF compilation,
an unexpected end-of-file was encountered while re-reading the
partially compiled file. The file was corrupted during the
compilation. Re-try the compilation; if it fails again, see the TAE
system manager. <P>

<STRONG>RDERR</STRONG> An I/O error was encountered while reading
records from the specified file. The file is either missing or
corrupt. If an error code is given, use local system utilities to
interpret the error code; also use local system utilities to check the
integrity of the file. If the problem is not then evident, see the
SystemManager. <P>

<STRONG>REDEF</STRONG> If a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> proc contains a
<CODE>PARM</CODE> command for a global that already exists, it must
use the same <CODE>TYPE</CODE>, <CODE>ACCESS</CODE>, and
<CODE>COUNT</CODE>, as the existing global. Correct the
<CODE>PARM</CODE> commands to agree, or rename one of the
variables. To determine the attributes of the existing global named
<VAR>gx</VAR>, determine the defining PDF, TUTOR on it, and type
<CODE>HELP <VAR>gx</VAR></CODE> <P>

<STRONG>REFEX</STRONG> A <CODE>REFGBL</CODE> command may not refer to
a global variable with the same name as an existing local variable or
parameter. Change the name of the conflicting local or parameter
variable, or do not reference the global variable. <P>

<STRONG>REFS</STRONG> A proc contains more <CODE>REFGBL</CODE>
statements than are supported at this TAE installation. Delete one or
more of the <CODE>REFGBL</CODE> statements. See the TAE system manager
to determine the number of <CODE>REFGBL</CODE> statements supported at
your installation. (The number is defined by the <CODE>MAXREF</CODE>
parameter in the <CODE>TAECONF</CODE> include file.) <P>

<STRONG>RELNULL</STRONG> One of the variables in a relational
expression with the operator ">", "<", "<=", or ">=" contained a null
value ("<CODE>--</CODE>"). The null value is not allowed in relational
expressions except for "=" and "<>". The variable must be given a
non-null value. Note that if the <CODE>$COUNT</CODE> TCL function
returns a 0 for the count of a variable then the current value is the
null value. <P>

<STRONG>REMOVE</STRONG> If you submit more asynchronous jobs than TM
can maintain in its asynchronous job list, TAE tries to remove the
first inactive job from the async list to make room for the incoming
job. If successful, TM informs you the name of the removed inactive
job with this message. No action required. <P>

<STRONG>REPWAIT</STRONG> Either there was a request to wait on a job
that is itself waiting for dynamic parameters, or a request for
dynamic parameters came from a job during a wait. If a job is waiting
for dynamic parameters, the job must be explicitly continued before
you can wait for its completion. Use the <CODE>REPLY</CODE> command to
either abort or continue the job. <P>

<STRONG>RESALL</STRONG> TAE reserves the word <CODE>ALL</CODE> to
imply all asynchronous jobs. Resubmit the job with a different
acceptable job name. <P>

<STRONG>RESERVED</STRONG> The name used for a variable is a reserved
word in TCL and may not be used as a variable name. Rename the
variable. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's Manual</CITE> for
a list of reserved names. <P>

<STRONG>RESFORMAT</STRONG> The indicated TAE Plus resource file
could not be read because of a problem accessing the records. The
file has been corrupted. Repeat the operation. If the operation
continues to fail, the resource file must be re-created. <P>

<STRONG>RESTPARM</STRONG> TAE does not allow parameters to be created
by a <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command. There exists a parameter in the
file for which there is no corresponding parameter in the proc of the
<CODE>RESTORE</CODE> command. You may first create a local variable
corresponding to each non-existent parameter and then
<CODE>RESTORE</CODE> the parameters into these locals using the
<CODE>TARGET</CODE> key word. <P>

<STRONG>REWFAIL</STRONG> The host returned an error when attempting
to rewind your tape. The host message given with this key should
explain the error. Interpret the host message and act accordingly.
<P>

<STRONG>RUNINT</STRONG> Internal procs may only be run interactively
that is, they may not be invoked with the command qualifier
<CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> set to <CODE>BATCH</CODE> or
<CODE>ASYNC</CODE>. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Manual</CITE> for details on internal procs. <P>

<STRONG>RUNSHELL</STRONG> On UNIX systems, the Terminal monitor could
not invoke the UNIX/shell in response to the <CODE>USH</CODE>
command. This problem may be caused if the system process table is
full or due to configuration or hardware problems. See the TAE system
manager. <P>

<STRONG>RUNTYPE</STRONG> The <CODE>RUNTYPE</CODE> qualifier, if
specified, must be set to <CODE>INTERACTIVE</CODE> (the default),
<CODE>BATCH</CODE>, or <CODE>ASYNC</CODE>. This situation sometimes
occurs when a qualifier is placed in the wrong position after the
"|". Re-issue the command with <CODE>BATCH</CODE> or
<CODE>ASYNC</CODE> as the qualifier, or with the qualifiers in their
appropriate positions. <P>

<STRONG>SAVELAST</STRONG> TUTOR is unable to save the current
parameter set on disk. (Whenever you <CODE>RUN</CODE> from TUTOR mode,
your set of parameters is saved in a parameter file named
<CODE>LAST</CODE>.) This error is usually caused by one of the
following: 1) The current default directory is protected against file
creation. 2) Your disk space or file quota has been exceeded. 3) In
VMS, the logical name <CODE>LAST</CODE> has been assigned to some file
specification that is not valid. Despite the error message, TUTOR has
properly executed the proc. <P>

<STRONG>SAVERR</STRONG> The parameter save operation cannot be
performed because of an I/O error writing to the file, because the
file cannot be opened, or because the TAE monitor does not have
sufficient internal storage to accommodate all the parameter values.
Use the local operating system I/O error code listed in the error
message to determine the source of the error. See the documentation on
the operating system or the System Manager for further action. <P>

<STRONG>SAVEWRT</STRONG> The disk file that is to hold the variable
values from a <CODE>SAVE</CODE> command cannot be written. This
typically indicates a disk error or a disk space quota problem. <P>

<STRONG>SAVRST</STRONG> Your parameters have been successfully saved
to or restored from the specified file. No action is necessary; the
message is informational. <P>

<STRONG>SCRCNT</STRONG> One of the parameters to the
<CODE>ENABLE-SCRIPT</CODE> command is the number of times the script
is to be executed. A negative number for this parameter has no
meaning. <P>

<STRONG>SIZERR</STRONG> On a UNIX system, the number and size of all
parameters are too large to transmit to the application process. (Note
that the total size required is affected by both the number of
parameters and the number of components in all parameters.) Try to
find a way to reduce the size of the amount of information to send in
the parameter block. For example, try using a shell environment
variable for long file names. If this is not possible, reduce the
number of parameters required or the number of components in
parameters. <P>

<STRONG>SNDERR</STRONG> An I/O error occurred while sending a
message to a process. The message usually contains process
parameters. There is a configuration problem or a host system
problem. See the System Manager to check your quotas (especially the
<CODE>BYTLM</CODE> quota). <P>

<STRONG>STDOPEN</STRONG> This key is returned as status in
<CODE>$SKEY</CODE> when a program cannot open the standard output. The
standard output, used for default program output, is specified using
the <CODE>STDOUT</CODE> command qualifier; it defaults to a the
terminal if the proc is run interactively. Check the name of the
standard output file; confirm that you have privileges to write to
that file. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language User's Manual</CITE> for
more details on standard output. <P>

<STRONG>STDOOPN</STRONG> The standard output could not be opened.  The
standard output file is the file specified through the
<CODE>STDOUT</CODE> qualifier on a command line. Note that the
<CODE>STDOUT</CODE> qualifier may have been used in a procedure. Use
local system utilities to check if the file exists and to check if you
have the appropriate privileges to write to the file. (If, under
VAX/VMS, you have used the DCL command, <CODE>SET DEFAULT</CODE>, to
change to another user's directory, you may not have the appropriate
privileges.) Use the local operating system I/O error code listed in
the error message to determine the source of the error. See the
documentation on the operating system or the System Manager for
further action. <P>

<STRONG>STDOUTOPEN</STRONG> This key is returned as status in
<CODE>$SKEY</CODE> when a program cannot open the standard output. The
standard output, used for default program output, is specified using
the <CODE>STDOUT</CODE> command qualifier. Use local system utilities
to check if the file exists and to check if you have the appropriate
privileges to write to the file. If VAX/VMS, If you have used the DCL
command, <CODE>SET DEFAULT</CODE>, to change to another user's
directory, you may not have the appropriate privileges. Use the local
operating system I/O error code listed in the error message to
determine the source of the error. See the documentation on the
operating system or the System Manager for further action. See the
<CITE>TAE Command Language User's Manual</CITE> for more details on
standard output.  <P>

<STRONG>STDOWRT</STRONG> An I/O error was encountered while writing to
the standard output file. The standard output file is the file
specified through the <CODE>STDOUT</CODE> qualifier on a command
line. Note that the <CODE>STDOUT</CODE> qualifier may have been used
in a procedure. There is a configuration problem or a host system
problem. See the System Manager to check your quotas and the
hardware. Use the local operating system I/O error code listed in the
error message to determine the source of the error. See the
documentation on the operating system or the System Manager for
further action. <P>

<STRONG>STOLEN</STRONG> The tape drive was stolen by another user
during the attempt to initialize the tape. Due to a bug in VMS, the
tape must be initialized in the subprocess which means the drive must
be deallocated from the parent and reallocated in the subprocess.
During this time, there is a small chance that the drive can get
stolen by another user. The same thing happens after the
initialization to transfer control back to the parent. Please notify
the VICAR system programmers if this happens. Either wait for the tape
drive to free up again, or get a different drive. <P>

<STRONG>STRSIZ</STRONG> The declaration of the type for the named
variable included a string size that is greater than the maximum.
Correct the string size. The longest string in TAE is defined by the
TAE configuration file. <P>

<STRONG>SUBAVL</STRONG> This message lists the names of the
subcommands available for the proc that you attempted to execute.
Subcommands are keywords that select a sub-function of a command.
Re-enter the command and prefix one of the subcommands to the command
name. The subcommand should be separated from the command with a
dash. For example: <CODE>SETLIB-ADD (lib1, lib2, lib3)</CODE> To
obtain a description of each subcommand, type the following:
<CODE>TUTOR <VAR>command</VAR>-</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>SUBCFMT</STRONG> The subcommand name, that is, the word after
the dash, is incorrectly formatted. Correct the command to use a
proper subcommand format. A valid subcommand name contains eight or
fewer characters, starts with a letter or underscore or dollar sign,
and may contain any of the following characters: any number (0-9), any
letter (A-Z, a-z), dollar sign ($), or underscore (_). <P>

<STRONG>SUBERR</STRONG> An internal TAE error has occurred while
tutoring on a subcommand. The most common cause of the error is that
TAE has run out of dynamic memory. <P>

<STRONG>SUBNST</STRONG> An attempt to nest subcommand definitions
occurred. Within the statements bracketed by <CODE>SUBCMD</CODE> and
<CODE>END-SUB</CODE>, only parameter and variable definitions are
allowed; another subcommand bracket is not allowed. Correct the
procedure containing the nested subcommands. <P>

<STRONG>SUBREQ</STRONG> The command must be accompanied by a
subcommand. A subcommand selects a group of parameters from among
several groups the command may recognize. The format to include a
subcommand is <CODE>proc-subcommand parameters</CODE> to invoke
<VAR>proc</VAR> with subcommand <VAR>subcommand</VAR>; the dash is
required. An example: <CODE>HELP-PARM p1 proc1</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>SUBTWC</STRONG> One of the following errors has occurred: 1)
The subcommand typed by the user is ambiguous, i.e., the subcommand is
a truncated abbreviation for more than one of the valid
subcommands. 2) The proc definition is incorrect because a given
subcommand is defined twice. 1) Select a non-ambiguous spelling for
the desired subcommand and re-enter the command. 2) Fix the multiple
definition of the subcommand in the proc definition file. Use "TUTOR
<VAR>pr</VAR>-" to determine the subcommands for proc
"<VAR>pr</VAR>". <P>

<STRONG>SYMBOL</STRONG> You have issued a tape drive specific command
using a symbolic name which is not currently defined.  Re-issue the
command using the correct symbolic name or device specification. For
VAX/VMS, note: if you are entering a <CODE>MOUNT</CODE> command and
you have not allocated the drive, you must enter both the symbolic
name and the actual device name. <P>

<STRONG>SYNERR</STRONG> The command cannot be processed because the
format is unrecognizable. The error message attempts to identify the
area in the command where the format error occurred. Re-enter the
command. For information on the general rules for commands, type
<CODE>HELP</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>SYNTUTHLD</STRONG> This message informs the user that dynamic
TUTOR has been put on "hold" for an asynchronous job. The asynchronous
job requested dynamic parameters, the user entered <CODE>REPLY</CODE>,
and then <CODE>HOLD</CODE> to postpone the selection of parameter
values. The TCL command <CODE>GETPAR</CODE> requests dynamic
parameters for procedures. The TAE library routine <CODE>XQDYNP</CODE>
requests dynamic parameters for processes.  When ready to enter
parameter values for the asynchronous proc, enter <CODE>REPLY</CODE>
again. <P>

<STRONG>TEST</STRONG> Should never be displayed. Referenced by code in
<CODE>tae$olb:message.c</CODE> which, due to conditional compilation,
will only be compiled when doing internal testing. <P>

<STRONG>TINVSUBHLP</STRONG> Help on a subcommand other than the
current subcommand has been requested. The "current" subcommand is
established in TUTOR when you name it in a TUTOR subcommand display,
or, by default. The "current" subcommand is indicated in the upper
left corner of the TUTOR mode display. If you wish help on another
subcommand you must request it from TCL (using <CODE>HELP
<VAR>xxx-yyy</VAR></CODE> to get help on subcommand <VAR>yyy</VAR> in
proc <VAR>xxx</VAR>) or enter TUTOR mode for subcommands (<CODE>TUTOR
<VAR>xxx</VAR>-</CODE>"). <P>

<STRONG>TMEQASS</STRONG> The TUTOR parameter assignment command is
missing an "=". Use the following format for parameter value
assignment: <CODE><VAR>parameter-name</VAR> = <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
Examples: <CODE>CYCLE = 2, BIN(2) = 3, VECTOR = 1, 2, 3, 4</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>TMISPAR</STRONG> The TUTOR <CODE>RUN</CODE> command was used
while the listed parameters did not have values. Use the TUTOR
parameter value assignment command (<CODE><VAR>parameter</VAR> =
<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>) to set the values of the listed parameters,
and repeat the <CODE>RUN</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>TNISUBSC</STRONG> The value of a subscript for a variable is
not a positive integer. Correct the value and repeat the command.
<P>

<STRONG>TNODEFSUB</STRONG> While in TUTOR subcommand display, a hyphen
was typed with no following word, thereby choosing the default
subcommand. The current command, however, has no default subcommand.
Choose one of the subcommands listed in the subcommand display, and
type <CODE>-[<VAR>subcommand name</VAR>]</CODE>. (If a subcommand is
the default subcommand, it is marked <CODE>** DEFAULT **</CODE>.) <P>

<STRONG>TNODEF</STRONG> While in TUTOR mode, a parameter was assigned
a default value, using <CODE><VAR>parameter-name</VAR> = </CODE>,
(i.e., no explicit value on the right side of "=".) The named
parameter has no default value. Use <CODE><VAR>parameter-name</VAR> =
<VAR>value</VAR></CODE> to assign an explicit value. <P>

<STRONG>TNOLATCH</STRONG> When the TUTOR command is typed with no
proc name, TUTOR attempts to run using the "latched" parameters.
Parameters are latched (i.e., remembered) only when the previous proc
invocation had missing or incorrect parameters. Re-issue the TUTOR
command with a proc name. <P>

<STRONG>TNOLEV2</STRONG> The programmer who created the proc
has not specified detailed help for the parameter or subcommand.
Often the description of the proc itself will supply additional
information concerning parameters. Type <CODE>HELP *</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>TNOQUAL</STRONG> The <CODE>QUALIFY</CODE> command in TUTOR
mode tells TAE to enter TUTOR mode for parameter qualifiers. In this
case, there are no parameter qualifiers defined for the specified
parameter. Check the name of the parameter and check the declaration
of the parameter in the PDF. The method for declaring parameter
qualifiers is described in the <CITE>TAE Command Language Programmer's
Manual</CITE>.  <P>

<STRONG>TNOTPROC</STRONG> When in dynamic command mode, the only way
TUTOR may be entered is by using <CODE>TUTOR</CODE> alone, with no
proc name. It is not possible to TUTOR on procs other than the current
proc. Type <CODE>TUTOR</CODE> to enter TUTOR mode. <P>

<STRONG>TNOTUSED</STRONG> A parameter file was restored, or parameters
were provided by a program for a dynamic parameter session, in which
one of the following is true for one or more of the parameters: 1) A
parameter in the parameter file does not exist in the PDF used for the
TUTOR or dynamic parameter session. 2) The parameter does not have a
valid value (according to the declaration in the PDF). A common cause
of this condition is the use of <CODE>RESTORE</CODE> on a file that
does not match the current PDF. For example, the PDF may have been
changed since the parameter file was <CODE>SAVE</CODE>d. Check that
you have use the intended parameter file name. If a dynamic parameter
session has been initiated, determine if the generating program refers
to the correct PDF, and determine if implied characteristics of the
parameters used in the program agree with the declaration for the
parameters in the PDF. <P>

<STRONG>TNOTFOUND</STRONG> The string specified in the
<CODE>SEARCH</CODE> command could not be found anywhere in the list of
valid strings.  Check the spelling of the specified search string. If
it was correct, that string is not available. Try the
<CODE>SEARCH</CODE> command with a different string. <P>

<STRONG>TNPNAM</STRONG> While searching through help data to find
information on a named variable, a <CODE>.VARIABLE</CODE> help
directive was encountered with no parameter name. Correct the help
file to specify a name with <CODE>.VARIABLE</CODE> or inform the help
file author. <P>

<STRONG>TNPRCSYN</STRONG> TUTOR is available for any proc or for any
TCL intrinsic command that has proc invocation syntax. Commands like
<CODE>LET</CODE> have syntax incompatible with TUTOR mode. <P>

<STRONG>TNSCR</STRONG> A TUTOR command only available in the NOSCREEN
TUTOR mode was typed. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> to display the commands
available in the current TUTOR mode. <P>

<STRONG>TOLENB</STRONG> Terminal output logging was already active
when the user attempted to execute the <CODE>ENABLE-TOL</CODE>
command. <P>

<STRONG>TOOASYNC</STRONG> If a proc is repeatedly submitted to run
asynchronously, TAE maintains unique job names for the proc by
appending a unique two digit sequence number to the proc name. If all
the sequence numbers have already been assigned, it can no longer
create a job name for that proc. Either submit the asynchronous job
with a unique, explicit job name, or remove the completed asynchronous
jobs from the list (using the <CODE>REMOVE</CODE> command) and
resubmit your job.  <P>

<STRONG>TOOFEW</STRONG> The number of values specified for a
parameter is less than the minimum defined for the parameter. Use
TUTOR to determine the allowable minimum number of values and re-issue
the command accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>TOOFEWVAL</STRONG> An attempt has been made to set a component
value of a variable, but the operation is unacceptable because the
resulting component count would have been inconsistent with the
variable's declaration. For example, if <CODE>X</CODE> were declared
to have between 4 and 8 values and to be nullable, the following
sequence would produce the <CODE>TOOFEWVAL</CODE> error:
<PRE>
	LET X = --	!null value to X 
	LET X(1) = 10	!invalid: resulting count would be 1
</PRE>

<STRONG>TOOMANY</STRONG> The number of values specified for a
parameter is greater than the maximum defined for the parameter. Use
TUTOR to determine the allowable maximum number of values and re-issue
the command accordingly. Parameter help available in TUTOR mode should
describe the number of values allowed. <P>

<STRONG>TOOMNYFOR</STRONG> The number of values that may be assigned
using a <CODE>FOR</CODE> list is limited to 10 values. (A longer
<CODE>FOR</CODE> list may be simulated using a multi-valued local
variable, an index, and a <CODE>LOOP</CODE> construct.) Delete values
from the <CODE>FOR</CODE> list. <P>

<STRONG>TPAGNSC</STRONG> There are no TUTOR pages while in NOSCREEN
TUTOR. Use the <CODE>LIST</CODE> command to list the parameter values,
and the <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> command to display the parameter
descriptions. <P>

<STRONG>TPAGNUM</STRONG> The TUTOR <CODE>PAGE</CODE> command (or an
abbreviation, e.g., <CODE>PA</CODE>) was typed followed by a negative
number or zero. Use a positive page number. <P>

<STRONG>TQUNTCMD</STRONG> The requested command is not available
when tutoring for parameter qualifiers. The list of available
commands is given at the bottom of the qualifier screen. For an
explanation of each command, type <CODE>HELP</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>TRANSFAIL</STRONG> On VAX/VMS systems, TAE finds the current
directory tree (which contains all TAE system files) using the VMS
logical name <CODE>TAE</CODE>. Check that the logical name
<CODE>TAE</CODE> is defined in your user process; if it is, see the
System Manager.  <P>

<STRONG>TSELNAVAIL</STRONG> The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> display is not
available for the specified parameter. The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> display
is restricted to parameters that have a specified list of valid string
values. Do not attempt to use <CODE>SELECT</CODE> display for this
parameter. <P>

<STRONG>TSELNOTSCR</STRONG> The TUTOR command <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
brings up the <CODE>TUTOR/SELECT</CODE> screen. The
<CODE>TUTOR/SELECT</CODE> screen is not available in
<CODE>NOSCREEN</CODE> TUTOR. Do not use the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
command when using TUTOR in <CODE>NOSCREEN</CODE> mode. <P>

<STRONG>TSHOWPRM</STRONG> The <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command requires that
you type the name and index of the value that you want to see. Re-type
the <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command. Example: <CODE>SHOW X(4)</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>TSLUNTCMD</STRONG> The requested command is not available when
using the TUTOR select display. The list of available commands is
given at the bottom of the TUTOR select screen. For an explanation of
each command, type <CODE>HELP</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>TSUNTCMD</STRONG> The command is not a known command for TUTOR
subcommand display. Correct the command. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> for a
list of commands available while in TUTOR subcommand display. <P>

<STRONG>TTLERR</STRONG> The title information for a TUTOR, menu, or
help screen cannot be read from disk. This message usually indicates a
disk failure. <P>

<STRONG>TTOOVAL</STRONG> There are too many words on a
<CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> or <CODE>LIST</CODE> command. The format for a
<CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> or <CODE>LIST</CODE> command is: 1)
<CODE>DISPLAY/LIST</CODE>, 2) <CODE>DISPLAY/LIST <VAR>parameter
name</VAR></CODE>, or 3) <CODE>DISPLAY/LIST (<VAR>list of parameter
names</VAR>)</CODE>. In #1, all parameters are displayed or listed. In
#2, the specified parameter is displayed or listed. In #3, all the
parameters listed in parentheses are displayed or listed. <P>

<STRONG>TUNEXCH</STRONG> The command line extends beyond the expected
end for this command. Type <CODE>HELP</CODE> to display information on
the correct format for each TUTOR command. <P>

<STRONG>TUNRECPAR</STRONG> The word after the TUTOR command is not
recognized as an option associated with that command. Type
<CODE>HELP</CODE> to display information on the options for TUTOR
commands. <P>

<STRONG>TUTOERR</STRONG> The error message just prior to this one
explains the cause of this error. If there is no such error message,
then the error is an internal TAE error. <P>

<STRONG>TUTSUB</STRONG> The ampersand character was used
incorrectly in a TUTOR command. When an ampersand is used, it must be
followed immediately by the name of a TCL variable - the value of the
variable is then substituted, replacing the ampersand and the variable
name. An error occurs when an ampersand is not followed by a variable
name or when the variable is not known on the interactive level. If
you want an ampersand character itself to appear in a quoted string,
use two adjacent ampersands. <P>

<STRONG>TYPERRN</STRONG> Only proc interface parameters (declared
using <CODE>PARM</CODE>) may be declared to have type
<CODE>NAME</CODE>; <CODE>NAME</CODE>s not supported for global
variables, or for local variables. Change the declaration to use a
different type. <P>

<STRONG>TYPERR</STRONG> The allowed <CODE>TYPE</CODE> values are
<CODE>REAL</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>STRING</CODE>,
<CODE>KEYWORD</CODE>, <CODE>NAME</CODE>, or <CODE>FILE</CODE>. In
addition, for a <CODE>STRING</CODE> declaration, the maximum size of
the string may be declared using: <CODE>TYPE = (STRING,
[<VAR>size</VAR>])</CODE> Correct the command to use one of the types
listed above. <P>

<STRONG>UNBALCON</STRONG> The <CODE>FOR</CODE>, <CODE>LOOP</CODE>, and
<CODE>IF</CODE> commands require <CODE>END-FOR</CODE>,
<CODE>END-LOOP</CODE>, <CODE>END-IF</CODE>, respectively, to close the
construct.  Provide the necessary closing command. <P>

<STRONG>UNBALPAR</STRONG> An <CODE>IF</CODE> command is missing a
right parenthesis. Insert the necessary closing parenthesis. <P>

<STRONG>UNDEFCMD</STRONG> The named command is not a user-defined
command. The command is a TCL intrinsic command (which may not be
deleted), or the command has not been defined during the current
session. Correct the named command. The list of defined commands may
be displayed using <CODE>DISPLAY $DEFCMD0</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>UNDEFGBL</STRONG> A procedure contains a <CODE>REFGBL</CODE>
command for a global variable that has not been defined. Determine if
the name of the global is correctly specified. The following TAE
command will list the names of all currently defined globals:
<CODE>DISPLAY-GLOBALS</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>UNDEFSUB</STRONG> A subcommand name was used that is either
not defined for this command or is an ambiguous abbreviation. Type
<CODE>TUTOR <VAR>xxx</VAR>-</CODE> to TUTOR for any subcommand
associated with command "<VAR>xxx</VAR>", or type <CODE>HELP
<VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> to display information on the command. <P>

<STRONG>UNDEFVAR</STRONG> The named variable has not been defined.
Check the command. If a <CODE>LET</CODE> command is used to set the
value of a string variable, then the string value must be
quoted. String constants in <CODE>IF</CODE>, <CODE>FOR</CODE>, and
<CODE>ELSE-IF</CODE> commands must also be quoted. Examples: 
<PRE>
	LET STRING = "hello"	!quotes required 
	IF (STRING ="hello") !quotes required </PRE> If the variable
reference is intentional, then the procedure in which the
<CODE>LET</CODE> occurs should contain a <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> or
<CODE>PARM</CODE> command for the named variable, or there must be a
<CODE>REFGBL</CODE> for a global variable and the variable must be
defined in a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> proc. If the variable is a parameter
with type <CODE>NAME</CODE>, then the referenced variable is not local
to the procedure and should be in the scope of the calling
procedure. <P>

<STRONG>UNDLABEL</STRONG> A <CODE>GOTO</CODE> command refers to a
label that does not exist in the current procedure. Note that
<CODE>GOTO</CODE> commands may only reference a label in the forward
direction. Correct the procedure to eliminate the reference or insert
the label. If you need to do a backwards branch, use the
<CODE>LOOP</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>UNEXCH</STRONG> The command line extends beyond the expected
end for this command. If the command is a TCL command, type <CODE>HELP
[<VAR>command name</VAR>]</CODE> to display information on the correct
format for the command. In TUTOR mode, or in a menu, <CODE>HELP</CODE>
alone will display information on all commands. <P>

<STRONG>UNEXEOL</STRONG> The TAE expression analyzer encountered the
end of the line before the line analysis was complete. This error
message generally indicates an expression was encountered that does
not conform to the TCL rules for expression. Examples are arithmetic
expressions that end with an operator (e.g., "1-") or omitted right
parentheses. <P>

<STRONG>UNEXPECTH</STRONG> Help text was encountered in the middle of
a PDF, i.e., before the <CODE>end-proc</CODE>. Inform the author of
the proc that the help text is located in the incorrect place in the
PDF. <P>

<STRONG>UNRECCMD</STRONG> The named command is not a TCL intrinsic
command. This condition usually arises when the introductory command
(<CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE>, <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>, etc.) in a proc
definition file is missing and a proc invocation command appears
before the <CODE>BODY</CODE> command. <P>

<STRONG>UNRECSUB</STRONG> The named subcommand is not defined for the
associated command. (The subcommand is the first word following
<CODE>[<VAR>command name</VAR>]-</CODE>, e.g., in
<CODE>HELP-PARM</CODE>, <CODE>PARM</CODE> is the subcommand.)  Type
<CODE>TUTOR <VAR>xxx</VAR>-</CODE> for a list of subcommands
appropriate command <VAR>xxx</VAR>.  <P>

<STRONG>UNRECTTY</STRONG> Your terminal is not a known type. Therefore
it can not be supported by the TAE terminal package.  If this is a
hardcopy device, no action is necessary. For VAX/VMS: If this is a CRT
device, if <CODE>TERM$TABLOC</CODE> is defined, check that your
terminal is of a type listed in the file to which it points. If
<CODE>TERM$TABLOC</CODE> is not defined, make sure that your terminal
type is listed in the default VMS terminal table. For UNIX: If this is
a CRT device, check that the Unix environment variable,
<CODE>TERM</CODE>, is defined to be a terminal type listed in the file
pointed to by <CODE>$TERMCAP</CODE>. If <CODE>$TERMCAP</CODE> is
undefined, make sure that your terminal type is listed in the default
UNIX terminal table. <P>

<STRONG>USEDNAME</STRONG> The user has already submitted another
asynchronous job with the same job name. Either submit the
asynchronous job with a different name, or if the previous job with
that name is complete, remove it from the list (using the
<CODE>REMOVE</CODE> command) and then resubmit the current job. <P>

<STRONG>VALIDERR</STRONG> A variable declaration includes a
<CODE>VALID</CODE> specification with an incorrect format for the
range specification.  Find the errant declaration and correct the
range specification. A valid range specification is formatted "a:b"
where "a" is the lower number, and "b" is the higher number. The colon
is required and there may not be any spaces in the
specification. Example: <CODE>PARM I TYPE=INTEGER VALID=(1:80,
100:150)</CODE> <P>

<STRONG>VALIDREQ</STRONG> The definition of a proc parameter is
incorrect. The parameter is declared to be a <CODE>KEYWORD</CODE>
parameter, but the <CODE>VALID</CODE> list has been
omitted. <CODE>KEYWORD</CODE> parameters require a <CODE>VALID</CODE>
list. The PDF must be corrected. See the <CITE>TAE Command Language
Programmer's Manual</CITE> for a discussion on parameters of type
keyword. <P>

<STRONG>VARCNFLCT</STRONG> A variable already exists with the same
name. If this error message is received interactively, then the name
conflicts with a local that has been declared interactively or with
any of the global variables. Rename the variable. <P>

<STRONG>VBADCOUNT</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in
the executable code of a process. The <CODE>COUNT</CODE> argument in
an <CODE>XQ</CODE> call is either less than the minimum or greater
than the maximum allowed for the specified variable. Correct the
program so that the count is within the variable's limits. <P>

<STRONG>VBADNAME</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. The <CODE>NAME</CODE> argument in an
<CODE>XR</CODE> call refers to a variable that does not exist in the
V-block, or an <CODE>XQ</CODE> call has the mode argument set to
<CODE>xupdat</CODE> and the <CODE>NAME</CODE> argument refers to a
variable that does not exist. Correct the program or the PDF so that
the <CODE>NAME</CODE> argument refers to an existing variable. <P>

<STRONG>VBADPFILE</STRONG> An application program attempted to read a
parameter file by calling the <CODE>XRRDB</CODE> subroutine and the
parameter file is incorrectly formatted. Some possible causes of this
error are: 1) The file is not a parameter file. Parameter files must
be created by TAE's <CODE>SAVE</CODE> command or by calling
<CODE>XQWRTB</CODE> from a program.  2) The file was incorrectly
created by <CODE>XQWRTB</CODE> because the V-block argument was not
properly constructed. 3) The file is a parameter file created by an
old version of TAE. <P>

<STRONG>VBADTYPE</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. In an <CODE>XR</CODE> call or an
<CODE>XQ</CODE> call with <CODE>MODE</CODE> set to
<CODE>xupdat</CODE>, the type of the variable in the V-block does not
agree with the type implied by the name of the subroutine. (E.g.,
<CODE>XRREAL</CODE> expects a real variable.)  Determine the type of
the named variable and correct the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>VBLOCK</STRONG> The V-block has insufficient space to
accommodate the variables specified in a <CODE>SENDVAR</CODE>
request. Divide the list of variables into smaller lists and do
multiple <CODE>SENDVAR</CODE> requests. <P>

<STRONG>VDIMEN</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. In <CODE>XR</CODE> the <CODE>DIM</CODE>
argument is not large enough to receive the number of values for the
specified variable.  Determine the type of the <CODE>COUNT</CODE> of
the named variable and correct the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>VDUPNAME</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. In an <CODE>XQ</CODE> call, the
<CODE>MODE</CODE> was set to <CODE>xadd</CODE> and the
<CODE>NAME</CODE> of the variable was the name of a variable already
in the V-block. Use a different name for one of the variables, or use
the <CODE>xupdat</CODE> MODE for the <CODE>XQ</CODE> call. <P>

<STRONG>VNOPARM</STRONG> A program has attempted to add a qualifier
value to a V-block when the parameter being qualified does not exist.
Check the program against the PDF and make sure that the parameter
being qualified is defined in the intended PDF. <P>

<STRONG>VNOROOM</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. In an <CODE>XQ</CODE> call, the V-block
has insufficient space to accommodate the values specified. Increase
the size of the block. (See <CODE>XQINI</CODE>.) <P>

<STRONG>VOLDPARM</STRONG> A program has attempted to qualify a
variable that was created under a version of TAE prior to Version
1.3. Versions of TAE prior to version 1.3 did not support parameter
qualifiers. Variables saved under old versions of TAE cannot be
qualified. <P>

<STRONG>VTRANS</STRONG> This condition is caused by a problem in the
executable code of a process. In <CODE>XRFILE</CODE>, a variable
containing a file specification was read and could not be translated
using the Catalog Manager or the host operating system. If the user
typed the file name correctly determine why the file specification
could not be translated, and correct the program accordingly. <P>

<STRONG>WINDEXISTS</STRONG> An attempt was made to create a window
with the same name as a window that already exists. Use
<CODE>WINDOW-INFO</CODE> to determine the name of windows that already
exist. <P>

<STRONG>WINDOWCREATE</STRONG> In a <CODE>WINDOW-CREATE</CODE>
operation, the requested window could not be created. Check that the X
window system is active, and that you are on an appropriate bit-mapped
workstation.  <P>

<STRONG>WPTPANEL</STRONG> The requested panel could not be created.
Check that you have done a <CODE>WPT-INIT</CODE>. Check that the X
window system is active on your display system. <P>

<STRONG>WRGREC</STRONG> During the second phase of a PDF
compilation, an unexpected record format was encountered while
re-reading the partially compiled file. The file was corrupted during
the compilation. Re-try the compilation; if it fails again, see the
TAE system manager. <P>

<STRONG>WRTERR</STRONG> An I/O error was encountered while TAE was
writing the compilation output file. Interpret the associated host
error code and take the appropriate action. <P>

<STRONG>XTRAELSE</STRONG> An <CODE>ELSE</CODE> command was encountered
without a matching <CODE>IF</CODE>. Correct the procedure to eliminate
the unmatched <CODE>ELSE</CODE> or insert the <CODE>IF</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>XTRAENDFOR</STRONG> An <CODE>END-FOR</CODE> command was
encountered without a matching <CODE>FOR</CODE>. Correct the procedure
to eliminate the unmatched <CODE>END-FOR</CODE> or insert the
<CODE>FOR</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>XTRAENDLP</STRONG> An <CODE>END-LOOP</CODE> command was
encountered without a matching <CODE>LOOP</CODE>. Correct the
procedure to eliminate the unmatched <CODE>END-LOOP</CODE> or insert
the <CODE>LOOP</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>XTRELSIF</STRONG> An <CODE>ELSE-IF</CODE> command was
encountered without a matching <CODE>IF</CODE>. Correct the procedure
to eliminate the unmatched <CODE>ELSE-IF</CODE> or insert the
<CODE>IF</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>XTRENDIF</STRONG> An <CODE>END-IF</CODE> command was
encountered without a matching <CODE>IF</CODE>. Correct the procedure
to eliminate the unmatched <CODE>END-IF</CODE> or insert the
<CODE>IF</CODE>. <P>

<STRONG>ZEROJOB</STRONG> The user wanted to abort all asynchronous
jobs when there was none active. Check the list of completed
asynchronous jobs using <CODE>SHOW-ASYNC</CODE>. <P>
