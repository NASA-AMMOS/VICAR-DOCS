<A NAME="3.1">
<H2>3.1	Background</H2>
</A>

VICAR is a set of computer programs and procedures designed to
facilitate the acquisition, processing and handling of digital image
data.  The VICAR image processing language was defined by JPL
employees Stan Bressler, Howard Frieden and Fred Billingsley, and
implemented in 1966 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to process image
data produced by the planetary exploration program.  The software
package was originally designed for operation with the IBM 360/44
Programming System (44PS) and was later modified to run with the IBM
OS/360 operating system.  In the early 1980's VICAR underwent a major
revision to run under the VMS operating system on the VAX series of
Digital Equipment Corporation computers.  Now, in the early 1990's,
VICAR is once again undergoing a major revision and will soon be fully
operational under both the SunOS and Solaris UNIX operating
systems. <P>

For its command-line interface, VICAR makes use of the Transportable
Applications Executive (TAE) that was developed by the NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center.  This version of VICAR makes use of several
enhancements to TAE, which should be included with your version of
VICAR.  Several VICAR programs may not run without these
enhancements. <P>

The VICAR executive is a body of software that forms the interface
between the user, the library of application programs and procedures,
and the computer's operating system.  The VICAR executive does not
replace the host computer's operating system; instead, it overlays the
host resources.  The objectives of the VICAR executive are to: <P>

<UL> 
<LI>standardize the user interface to application programs and
procedures 
<LI>provide an interface that can be easily understood and
used by experts and non-experts 
<LI>shield the user from the host
operating system by making device-specific details transparent to the
user (e.g., display devices) 
<LI>simplify programming for future
expansions 
</UL> 
<P>
 
VICAR's application library contains an extensive assortment of
programs and procedures to perform a wide variety of functions
(Appendices <A HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.1">10.1</A>, <A
HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.2">10.2</A> and <A
HREF="vug10.1-3.html#10.3">10.3</A>).  These programs are written in
standard programming languages, FORTRAN, C and C++, with small
segments in VAX assembler and array processor code (not portable
code). <P>

The user interfaces with the VICAR executive via a series of TAE
Command Language (TCL) statements (<A HREF="vug7.html#7.1">Section
7.1</A>).  Through TCL, the user directs VICAR to invoke the programs,
procedures and commands to perform the analytical and housekeeping
activities necessary to complete a required task. <P>

Programs interface with the VICAR executive via a standard set of
subroutines that perform image, label and parameter processing plus
control several external devices such as display devices and printers
(Figure 3.1). The interface is known as the VICAR Run-time Library
(see the <CITE>VICAR Run-time Library Reference Manual</CITE>).  Other
libraries exist that provide access to databases, external devices
such as display devices and printers, etc.  The subroutines are
designed to reduce some of the routine labor involved in writing an
application program. <P>

Because of its modular architecture and portability, the VICAR system
will continue to grow.  New capabilities are being added to take
advantage of new technology, to meet the demands of the user, and to
provide support for new application areas. <P>

<H3>3.1.1 VICAR Changes Under UNIX</H3>
</A>

For the most part, the changes to VICAR that enable it to run on the
UNIX operating system should be transparent to the user.  However,
there are a few things that have changed that the user should be aware
of.  These differences between the VAX/VMS and UNIX VICAR systems are
covered in the following subsections: <P>

<A NAME="3.2">
<H2>3.2	Applications of VICAR</H2>
</A>

VICAR's application has expanded over time and now supports image
processing for many disciplines:   planetary imaging, astronomy, earth
resources, land use, biomedicine and forensics.  Facilities using
VICAR are world-wide and include:   universities, the military,
research institutions, aerospace corporations, commercial/industrial
companies and the Galileo HIIPS (Home Institution Image Processing
Subsystem) sites.  <P>

VICAR is available to organizations through the Computer Software
Management and Information Center (COSMIC): <P>
