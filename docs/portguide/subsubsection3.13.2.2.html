<P>
The <tt> vunpack</tt> program does precisely what its name suggests - it unpacks
files from a COM file created by <tt> vpack</tt>.  Its primary use is on systems
other than VMS, where the COM file is not self-extracting.  It may of course
be used under VMS also.
<P>
The <tt> vunpack</tt> program accepts a list of parameters as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vunpack &lt;file.com&gt;  [{source|pdf|imake|build|make|
                      test|repack|doc|std|system|unpack|all}]
</TT></PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vunpack &lt;file.com&gt; -f file.1 file.2 file.3
</TT></PRE>
<P>
As in the <tt> vpack</tt> program, if you call the <tt> vunpack</tt> program with
no parameters, the program will tell you that you made an error and will tell
you the proper syntax to use.
<P>
The first parameter tells <tt> vunpack</tt> which COM file to extract files from,
and the remaining (optional) parameters tell the program which file(s) to
extract.  You may extract more than one type of file, if desired, by putting
more than one type on the command line, separated by spaces.  If no parameters
other than the COM file name are provided, the program unpacks all the files
in the COM file.
<P>
The <tt> vunpack</tt> program will not automatically compile and link the
program, but it can extract the imakefile so that you can create the BLD file
(VMS) or makefile (Unix) which can create the executable for you.  See
Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Vimake, for details.
<P>
The <tt> vunpack</tt> program also allows you to extract a list of specified
files from the COM file.  Instead of unpacking groups of files, by specifying
``<tt> -f</tt>'' and supplying a list of one or more file names, you can have
<tt> vunpack</tt> unpack only the file(s) you need.
<P>
For example, if only host.c was needed from the view.com file, you would type
the following:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vunpack view.com -f host.c
</TT></PRE>
<P>
However, if you need all of the source files and the imakefile from VIEW.COM,
you would type the following:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vunpack view.com source imake
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The <tt> vunpack</tt> program will extract files from the COM file and put them
in the current directory, but it will not alter the COM file in any way.
