<P>
This section addresses how pixel data is stored in a VICAR file so it may
be accessed by different machines, and the reasoning behind that decision.
<P>
Conversion among hosts would be greatly simplified if everything were stored
in ASCII instead of in a binary representation.  In fact, that is how the
image labels are stored.  However, that is terribly inefficient in both time
and space for image data.  Image data must be stored in a binary
representation.  The question is, which one?
<P>
A standard, canonical representation could be chosen, for example that
everything must be stored in Sun format (which is big-endian, IEEE floating
point).  That would simplify the file format a little, but it would lead to
very inefficient operation on other machines with different formats.  If you
were doing processing locally on a VAX, and every pixel had to be converted
to Sun format every time it got read in or written out for every processing
step, there wouldn't be enough coffee in the world to keep you awake while
waiting!  Besides, due to the huge quantity of existing images written in
VAX format, the canonical representation would have to be VAX format, which
is not desirable in the long run.
<P>
Since most processing is done locally on one machine, and transfers between
machine architectures are comparatively less frequent, the solution is to use
the native format of whatever machine you are running on, and to identify that
machine in the image label.  That way, local operations are done efficiently,
and conversion is done only when switching machines.
<P>
Should the user be responsible for converting the data when moving to a
different machine, or should it be automatic?  In the first VICAR conversion,
from the IBM to the VAX, the user was responsible for running a conversion
program.  This was reasonable at the time, since there was no direct
connection between the machines, and data from the old format had to be
read off tape.  Since that is a manual operation, an extra manual step
was acceptable.
<P>
In this port, however, the situation is very different.  MIPL will have a
heterogeneous operating environment, with many different computers and
different data representations running simultaneously.  It is quite likely
that they will share the same disk farm over the network, so the same data
is transparently available on all the machines.  The user may not be aware
of what machine the file was created on.  Therefore, it is unreasonable to
expect the user to do his/her own translations.  It must be handled
automatically, and be completely transparent to the user.  The user may
notice a slowdown if the conversion is being performed, but the operation
will still take place as expected.
<P>
This places the burden of data format translation squarely on the shoulders
of the programmers.  Applications <em> must</em> be able to do data format
translations automatically.  In order to ease the burden somewhat, the
following conventions have been adopted:
<P>
<blockquote> 
<b> Applications shall be able to read files from any host representation.</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
<b> Applications shall normally write files in the native host representation
of the machine on which they are currently running.</b>
</blockquote>
<P>
Placing the burden only on the read side greatly simplifies the write side,
while still ensuring that the translations will take place in all cases.
Some special-purpose applications may choose to write in a non-native
format on occasion; however, <em> all applications must be able to read all
formats, without exception</em>.
<P>
The Run-Time Library relieves a large part of this burden.  When the standard
I/O routines are called (<b> x</b>/<b>  zvread</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvwrit</b>), the translations as
stated above are performed automatically for the image data.  The application
merely calls <b> x</b>/<b>  zvread</b> and it receives the data in the native format, ready
for processing.  It calls <b> x</b>/<b>  zvwrit</b>, and the data is written out in the
native format (which is what the buffer is in).
<P>
There are cases where applications will have to do their own conversion,
however.  The major ones are listed below.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Binary labels:  Binary labels (both headers and prefixes) are a major
concern, enough that they have their own section below.
<P>
<LI> Array I/O:  Any program using Array I/O will get the data as it exists
in the file, <em> without</em> any translation.  Applications using Array I/O are
responsible for doing their own data format translations on the data they read.
This makes Array I/O much less attractive in many cases, but it is necessary.
<P>
<LI> Convert OFF:  It is possible for an application to turn off the RTL's
automatic conversion.  This should not normally be done, but is available
for special cases.  If this option is selected, the application must do its
own translation.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
In all cases the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans</b> family of RTL routines should be used
to do the translations.  Do <em> not</em> attempt to write your own data format
conversion routines, even if you think it's only byte-swapping.  Although at
the present time byte-swapping is the only integer conversion, this may not
always be the case.  Other integer representations exist, such as
one's-complement and sign-magnitude, that cannot be translated by a simple
byte swap.  By having only one set of conversion routines, porting
to a new platform with a different data format is easier.  Plus, the
translations are standardized, and thoroughly debugged.  The <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans</b>
routines are coded to be efficient, especially for simple byte-swapping,
so there is no need to write your own.
