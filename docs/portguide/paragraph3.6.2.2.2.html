<P>
Set up a translation buffer for input.  The data will be converted from a host
representation of (SIHOST,SRHOST) and data type of STYPE into the machine's
native representation and data type DTYPE.  So, it converts from foreign
to local format.  Since all processing must be done in native format on the
machine the program is running on, this translation is most often needed
for input from a file.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> BUF: integer-array(12), output
<P>
BUF is the translation buffer that this routine will set up, describing the
translation to be performed.
<P>
<LI> STYPE: string, input
<P>
STYPE is the source data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT label item
in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:  ``BYTE'',
``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''.  The types ``WORD'',
``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete and should
not be used.
<P>
<LI> DTYPE: string, input
<P>
DTYPE is the desired destination data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT
label item in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:
``BYTE'', ``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''. The types
``WORD'', ``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete
and should not be used.
<P>
<LI> SIHOST: string, input
<P>
SIHOST is the host representation for the source of integral data types.
It corresponds to the INTFMT label item in a file.  It may be any of the
supported integer data types, which are listed in Table <A HREF=subsection3.7.2.html#intfmtlabel><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>.
It may also be ``NATIVE'' or ``LOCAL'', both of which mean the native
host INTFMT.  Note that SIHOST should be given even if you are dealing
only with floating-point data types.  See also <b> x</b>/<b>  zvhost</b>.
<P>
<LI> SRHOST: string, input
<P>
SRHOST is the host representation for the source of floating-point data types.
It corresponds to the REALFMT label item in a file.  It may be any of the
supported floating-point data types, which are listed in
Table <A HREF=subsection3.7.2.html#realfmtlabel><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>.  It may also be ``NATIVE'' or ``LOCAL'', both of
which mean the native host REALFMT.  Note that SRHOST should be given even if
you are dealing only with integral data types.  See also <b> x</b>/<b>  zvhost</b>.
<P>
<LI> STATUS: integer, output
<P>
The returned status value.  It is an argument in Fortran and the function
return value in C.  Any value other than SUCCESS indicates that the translation
is invalid for some reason, and the translation buffer should not be used.
