<P>
Returns the names of property subsets in the given file.  Property labels
are broken up into subsets, each with a property name.  This routine returns
a list of all property names in the file specified by UNIT, which must be
open.  This routine is identical to <b> x</b>/<b>  zlhinfo</b>, except that it returns
property names instead of task names and instances.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> UNIT: integer, input
<P>
UNIT is the unit number of an open file.  The property names in the property
label of this file are returned.
<P>
<LI> PROPERTIES: output, string array
<P>
PROPERTIES is a string array that gets the list of property names.  When
<b> zlpinfo</b> is called from C, the size of each string in the array is given
by the ULEN optional argument (which is required from C).  There is no
8-character default as there is in <b> zlhinfo</b>.  From Fortran, ULEN is
optional, since the string length is obtained from the array itself (which
must of course be a CHARACTER*n array).  Since property names can be up to
32 characters, you should declare a Fortran array to be at least CHARACTER*32,
and a C array should be at least 33 characters long (one additional character
for the null terminator).  The number of strings in the array is specified by
the NPROP argument.
<P>
<LI> NPROP: input/output, integer
<P>
On input, NPROP is the major dimension (maximum number of strings) in
PROPERTIES.  On output, it returns the number of properties returned in
PROPERTIES.  If there are more properties than the input NPROP allows, then
the returned NPROP will be the same as the input since the maximum number
of properties are returned.  If you want the total number of properties in
the label, regardless of the size of your supplied buffer, use the NRET
optional argument.
<P>
<LI> STATUS: integer, output
<P>
The returned status value.  It is an argument in Fortran and the function
return value in C.  Any value other than SUCCESS indicates that the routine
failed for some reason, and the returned values may not be valid.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<b> Optional Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> ERR_ACT: input, string
<P>
Indicates the action to be taken by the RTL when an error occurs in this
routine.  A valid string may contain one or more of the characters listed
below, in any order.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>A
<DD>: Abort the program on error; otherwise the routine returns with STATUS
set.
<DT>U
<DD>: Print the string specified in ERR_MESS if an error occurs.
<DT>S
<DD>: Print a system error message describing the error.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
The three values are independent of each other.  Thus, ``SA'' will cause a
system error message to be printed and the program to abort if an error
occurs.  If ERR_ACT is empty or contains only blanks, no action will be
taken on error, and the error code will be returned in STATUS.
<P>
If ERR_ACT is not specified, then the action defaults to the value of the
LAB_ACT optional to <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b>.  The default for LAB_ACT is specified by
<b> x</b>/<b>  zveaction</b>.
<P>
<LI> ERR_MESS: input, string
<P>
Specifies the user message to be printed when an error occurs as directed
by ERR_ACT.
<P>
Note that if the ERR_ACT option is not specified, and the LAB_ACT option
given to <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b> specifies that a message be printed, the message given by
LAB_ACT, <em> not</em> ERR_MESS, is printed.
<P>
<LI> NRET, output, integer
<P>
NRET returns the total number of properties in the label.  This can differ
from the NPROP argument if the buffer provided was too small.  NPROP returns
the number actually in the buffer, while NRET returns the total number
available.
<P>
<LI> ULEN, input, integer
<P>
ULEN specifies the length of each element in the PROPERTIES array.  ULEN is
required on <b> zlpinfo</b> when called from C to define the inner dimension
of the array.  Make sure to leave space for the null terminator, so ULEN
should be at least 33.  From Fortran, ULEN is optional.  If it is not given,
the string length will be picked up from the string array itself.  The
CHARACTER*n variable should be at least 32 characters.
