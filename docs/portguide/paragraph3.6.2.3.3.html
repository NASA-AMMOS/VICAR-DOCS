<P>
Sends a command string to TAE to be executed, and returns output values in
the interactive parblock, accessible by the <b> x</b>/<b>  zviparm</b> family of routines.
The command must be a TAE intrinsic command, or a procedure PDF that uses
only intrinsic commands, i.e. no processes, no DCL or shell.  This is mainly
intended for running VIDS procedures from within a program, but it may have
other applications as well.
<P>
This routine is quite similar to <b> x</b>/<b>  zvcommand</b>.  The only difference is that
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvcmdout</b> makes any output variables accessible.  This is most useful
with the VIDS JGET command, which returns values to the caller in TAE
variables.  These variables are placed in the interactive parblock.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> COMMAND: string, input
<P>
The command string to execute.  It may be a TAE intrinsic command or a
procedure PDF which uses intrinsic commands only (this includes almost all
VIDS PDF's).  All potential outputs from the executed command will be in the
form of NAME parameters.  The values you wish returned should be declared as
local variables in the PDF for the program (the one you're writing, not the
one being called).  These local variables should then be passed in the
COMMAND string as values for the NAME parameters in the executed command.
The variables can then be accessed from the interactive parblock via the
<b> x</b>/<b>  zviparm</b> family of routines.
<P>
<LI> STATUS: integer, output
<P>
The returned status value.  It is an argument in Fortran and the function
return value in C.  Any value other than SUCCESS indicates that the command
didn't execute or the outputs didn't get returned correctly, and the returned
values should not be used.
