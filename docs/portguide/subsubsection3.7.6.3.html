<P>
Historically, there has been no way to determine what kind of binary label was
on a file, just the size of it.  You could guess it was a certain kind
(like a Voyager label), but if you were incorrect you would get invalid data,
with no error checking.  You simply had to know beforehand what kind of data
you had.
<P>
In order to solve this problem, a new system label has been added, called
BLTYPE (Binary Label TYPE).  While BLTYPE does not affect portability
<i> per se</i>, it does greatly improve the documentation of files and it makes
the VICAR system more robust.  Everyone using binary labels, whether they are
working on a portable program or not, is encouraged to make use of BLTYPE.
<P>
BLTYPE is simply a string that describes the kind of binary label present in
the file.  It may be set via <b> x</b>/<b>  zvadd</b> or <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b>, or by calling <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b>
on an already open file.  No error checking or valid values are enforced by
the RTL, so it is up to application programmers to make sure it is used
properly.
<P>
The BLTYPE string should be a short string (maximum 32 characters) that gives
a name to the binary label type.  It does not attempt to describe the fields
in the binary label at all, but merely provides a pointer to how the fields
could be determined.  Some of the currently registered names are
``GLL_SSI_EDR'', ``IBIS'', and ``M94_HRSC''.
<P>
In order to maintain a consistent set of names, a name registry (similar to
the one for properties) has been established for BLTYPE.  Every value for
BLTYPE must be entered into this registry, with a pointer to documentation
describing the layout of the binary label.  If you want to create a new kind
of binary label, simply tell the keeper of the registry what name you want
to use and what the layout is (either explicitly or by stating that it is
in document ).  The registrar will check for duplicates, approve
your request, and enter your name into the registry.
<P>
At the present time, the keeper of this registry is the VICAR system
programmer.
<P>
It is important to note that the RTL makes no checks on the validity of the
names used.  It is the responsibility of each individual programmer to make
sure that they use this system. Failure to do so may result in your program
not being accepted for delivery.
<P>
Application programs that expect a certain kind of binary label should check
the value of BLTYPE to make sure that they have been given the correct type,
and should issue an error message if it is incorrect.  If BLTYPE is not
present or blank, assume that the binary label is of the correct type for
backwards compatibility.
<P>
More sophisticated application programs could use the BLTYPE field to enable
them to read several different kinds of binary labels.  These could be
different versions of the same basic binary label (e.g. a type of ``X V2.0''
for version 2 of the X label type), or they could be completely different
labels from different projects.  Widespread use of BLTYPE will eventually
allow a general-purpose program to be written that understands most if not
all of the binary label types.
