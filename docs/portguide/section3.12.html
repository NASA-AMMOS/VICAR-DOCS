 <H1>SUBLIB Subroutine Library</H1>
<P>
This section discusses the creation and use of new subroutines for the SUBLIB
library in VICAR.  Although the discussion mentions only the class 2
subroutine library (p2$sub), the rules apply to the class 1 and 3 libraries
(p1$sub and p3$sub) and other libraries (such as the HW library, hw$sub)
as well.
<P>
The new VICAR directory structure allows the creation of more than one
subroutine library in each application class.  For example, the general
SUBLIB library could be augmented with a Galileo-specific subroutine library
with the subroutines that apply only to the Galileo project.  Or, a Real-Time
subroutine library could be created with subroutines that apply only to the
Real-Time subsystem.  While this capability is not currently implemented
(there is only one subroutine library per class), the flexibility exists in
the system to add these extra libraries in the future if they are deemed
necessary.
<P>
It is important to remember that MIPL should not be doing a wholesale
conversion of SUBLIB.  Rather, subroutines should be converted as they are
needed in the process of porting programs.  Thus, if no ported programs use a
SUBLIB routine, then it will not get ported.  This helps keep the size of
SUBLIB down, and should eliminate some of the unnecessary routines.  The
practical upshot of this is that the contents of the new SUBLIB will be
changing constantly during the VICAR porting process.  Keep a close eye on the
available routines (the source code is in p2$sub or $P2SUB).  If you need
to port a SUBLIB routine, check to make sure nobody else is doing it, then if
not, let configuration management know you are doing it.  That way, duplication
of subroutines can be avoided.
