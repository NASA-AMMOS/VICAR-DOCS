 <H2>Other-Language Bridges</H2>
<P>
As mentioned previously, most SUBLIB routines written in Fortran need to have
a C bridge, and most routines written in C need a Fortran bridge.  The rules
for creating such bridges, and examples of them, are in Section <A HREF=section3.11.html#mixfortc><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
Mixing Fortran and C.
<P>
There are cases, although rare, where the alternate-language bridge will not be
needed.  For example, the routines <tt> mvcl</tt> and <tt> mvlc</tt> convert strings
between CHARACTER*n and BYTE arrays.  This function is not useful in C, since
C does not use CHARACTER*n variables and there are already routines to accept
them in arguments.  Therefore, these routines only need a Fortran interface,
since they will only ever be called from Fortran.
<P>
Another example might be some of the Real-Time subroutines.  The entire
Real-Time system is written in C, including some SUBLIB routines.  These
routines are designed to be called only from Real-Time, which is entirely in C.
Therefore, no Fortran bridge needs to be written for them.  These routines are
in SUBLIB even though they are used only by Real-Time because the Real-Time
system consists of more than one application program.
