<P>
This section describes how to convert data between different data types and
hosts, when the RTL does not do it for you.  Most of the time, the RTL will
take care of any data type and host conversions automatically.  There are
times, however, when you will need to do your own conversions.
<P>
The translation routines have two parts:  the setup routines, and the actual
translation routine.  The setup routines must be called first, to set up
a user-supplied buffer that describes the translation.  The translation routine
may then be called as many times as necessary to do the actual translation.
<P>
It is important to note that you can have as many translation buffers active
at the same time as you wish.  They can be set up ahead of time, then used
whenever they need to be in the program.  This is illustrated in the example
below.
<P>
There is really only one setup routine internally, which requires the data
type, integer format, and real format for both the source and the destination.
Since it is unwieldy to specify all six parameters every time something needs
translating, there are five setup routines that provide part of the information
for you.  They are all simply syntactic sugar for the internal setup routine.
These five are <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_set</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_in</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inu</b>,
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inb</b>, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_out</b>.  See the subroutine descriptions in
Section <A HREF=subsubsection3.6.2.2.html#transrtn><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Translation Routines, for details on each routine.
<P>
The question arises of where do these six parameters come from?  Either the
source or the destination will be in the native host representation, so only
the foreign machine need be specified.  For <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_set</b>, both source and
destination are the local machine.  The information for the foreign machine
will usually come from the label of the file being read.  This is made easier
by the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inu</b> routine.  For binary labels (which may be from a
different host type than the image), <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inb</b> can be used to get the
binary label host information.    On occasion, you may make use of the
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvhost</b> routine to get the INTFMT and REALFMT for a machine, given the
type of machine.  This allows the user to specify that the file be written
in a foreign format.  Although this is not the usual mode of operation for
VICAR, it is allowed.
<P>
An example should help to clarify things.  A file is being read which contains
a structure of mixed data type.  The structure needs to be converted to the
native format so it can be processed.  The structure could come from the
binary label of the file, or it could be the data in an old-style IBIS file.
It doesn't even have to be a VICAR file - the translation routines don't care.
The code below is partially C code and partially pseudocode.  It would have
to be fleshed out to compile or run.
