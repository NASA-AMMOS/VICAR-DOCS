 <H2>Test Routines</H2>
<P>
Test routines are required for every VICAR class 2 (R2LIB) application and
subroutine.  Test routines are largely the same as before, but there are a
few differences.
<P>
As before, programs and procedures typically have a procedure PDF as the
test routine.  This PDF must be portable as well.  See Section <A HREF=section3.10.html#porttcl><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
Porting TCL, for details on making a PDF portable.
<P>
Subroutines must have a test program that calls the subroutine, as well as
a procedure PDF that calls the test program.  The test program must be portable
as well, and should have its own imakefile and its own PDF.  So subroutines
often have four test files: the test program, the imakefile, the test program
PDF, and the test PDF that calls it.  All of these files go under the TEST file
category in <tt> vpack</tt>.  To run the test, you would first unpack just the
TEST files, run <tt> vimake</tt> on the test imakefile, build the program, and
finally execute the test PDF.
<P>
Keep in mind that the test programs and scripts should test all of the
major functions of the program, rather than just testing that the program
doesn't crash.  This is not a change, but it is a point that needs emphasizing.
<P>
The log that's generated when the test is run must in most cases be delivered
with the program.  This ensures that you run the test before delivery, in
order to make sure it still works.  You should really run <tt> diff</tt> on the
new log versus the old log, to make sure nothing changed.  In any case,
Test &amp; Integration will have to compare the logs.
<P>
One thing that really makes checking the logs difficult is the <tt> usage</tt>
statistics that TAE automatically puts in the log after each program execution.
The date, amount of time, page faults, etc. used will vary every time the test
is run, and yet make no difference in the results of the regression test.
The usage statistics generate lots of meaningless differences, which tend to
hide any real differences.
<P>
For this reason, the TAE global variable $AUTOUSAGE has been added to control
the automatic printing of usage statistics.  It can take three values,
``BATCH'', ``ALL'', and ``NONE''.  To use it, you must use the TAE command
``refgbl $AUTOUSAGE'' before the ``body'' statement, then you can set
it with a standard ``let'' command.  The values are described below.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> BATCH:  This is the default, and the way previous versions of VICAR
worked all the time.  In this mode, automatic usage statistics are printed
after every program execution in batch mode.  In interactive mode, usage
statistics are not printed unless the <tt> usage</tt> command is explicitly given.
<P>
<LI> ALL:  This causes automatic usage statistics to be printed after <em>
every</em> program execution, in both batch and interactive modes.
<P>
<LI> NONE:  This supresses automatic usage statistics in both batch and
interactive modes.  With ``NONE'' set, the only way to get the statistics is
via the <tt> usage</tt> command.
</UL>
<P>
It is recommended that $AUTOUSAGE be set to ``NONE'' in every test script, to
avoid meaningless usage statistics.
<P>
Note:  As of this writing, the <tt> usage</tt> command has not yet been implemented
under Unix, therefore $AUTOUSAGE has not either.
<P>
Another problem in the checking of test scripts is the issue of numerical
precision.  It is possible that the results of a test involving floating-point
calculations may be different on different machines in the least significant
few digits.  This is due to differences in numerical representation and
precision, as well as possible differences in library routines.  The acceptable
difference between the results is defined in the <i> MSTP Software Requirements
Document</i>, by Steve Pohorsky, JPL D-10637.
