 <H3>Using the Generated Unix Makefile</H3>
<A NAME=usemake><IMG SRC="/icons/invis_anchor.png"></A>
<P>
The generated Unix makefile is a fairly standard makefile.  Since most
VICAR programmers are not familiar with <tt> make</tt>, this section briefly
describes how to use it.  For more details on using <tt> make</tt>, see the
documentation for it.
<P>
In a nutshell, a makefile describes the dependencies between parts of an
application, and how to build those parts to create the output program.
Dependencies are simply the files that are needed to build a piece of the
program.  For example, the executable depends on all the object files and
the link libraries it needs.  Each object file depends on its corresponding
source file, and the include files that it uses.  A link library depends on
the object files that make it up.  Source code may depend on a preprocessor,
such as <tt> lex</tt> or <tt> yacc</tt>, or may come from a source code management
system.  All these dependencies can be tracked by <tt> make</tt>.  <tt> make</tt> is
smart enough to figure out what needs to be built based on what has changed,
and to build only those parts.  So, if you modify only one source module,
<tt> make</tt> checks the modification dates, realizes only one module has
changed, and recompiles only that module.
<P>
The <tt> vimake</tt>-generated makefile takes advantage of many of these features.
It does not allow specifying which include files are used by which source
files, but since VICAR applications are typically fairly small, this should
not cause a problem.  It may simply mean a few extra compiles.  Full automatic
dependency checking may be added to the makefile in the future.
<P>
By default, <tt> make</tt> looks for several filenames for the makefile, including
``Makefile'' and ``makefile''.  However, the generated makefile is named
``<i> file</i>.make'' where <i> file</i> is the name of the application.  Therefore,
you must give the ``<tt> -f</tt>'' option to <tt> make</tt> to specify the name of
the makefile.  If you are doing lots of development on one program, you may
rename the file to be ``Makefile'' (or better yet, create a symbolic link) so
<tt> make</tt> will find it automatically, but this precludes having more than one
application in the same directory, so it should not be done all the time.
To run <tt> make</tt>, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
make -f file.make targets
</TT></PRE>
<P>
where ``file'' is the name of the application and ``targets'' is an optional
list of targets to build (described below).
<P>
<tt> make</tt> operates through the use of targets.  A target is the final result
of the <tt> make</tt>.  A target could be an object file name, in which case that
file would get compiled.  It could be the executable name, in which case all
the compiles and links necessary to create the executable are performed.  There
are also special targets, such as ``all'' or ``clean.src'', that cause
certain actions to be performed.  More than one target may be given on the
same command, separated by spaces.
<P>
The targets available depend on whether you are building a PROGRAM,
SUBROUTINE, or PROCEDURE, and on how complex the build is.  The allowed targets
are listed below.  Not all targets will be available in all generated makefiles.
<P>
It is important to realize that there are fewer options on the makefile than
there are on the VMS BLD file.  This is largely due to the fact that <tt> make</tt>
takes care of a lot of the details for you.  You generally don't need to
specify compiling a single module, or only doing the link, because <tt> make</tt>
will determine what needs to be done and do it for you.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> std:  Builds a private version (``standard'') of the unit in the
current directory.  It is the default target if none is given.  It is valid
for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and PROCEDURE.  For type SUBROUTINE, the modules
are installed in the local link library (see library.local).
<P>
<LI> all:  Builds a private version of the unit in the current directory,
including the documentation.  It is valid for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and
PROCEDURE.  For type SUBROUTINE, the modules are installed in the local
link library (see library.local).
<P>
<LI> debug:  Builds a debuggable version of the unit (``<tt> -g</tt>'' option to
the compiler).  This target is only available on machines with conditional
macros in <tt> make</tt>, such as a Sun. On machines without conditional macros,
debug is not a valid target.  To build the program for debug on these machines,
you must set the DEBUG flag in the imakefile, and re-run <tt> vimake</tt>.  When
available, the debug target is valid for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> profile:  Builds a version of the unit for use with the profiler
(``<tt> -pg</tt>'' option to the compiler).  This target is only available on
machines with conditional macros in <tt> make</tt>, such as a Sun.  On machines
without conditional macros, profile is not a valid target.  To build the
program for use with the profiler on these machines, you must set the PROFILE
flag in the imakefile, and re-run <tt> vimake</tt>.  When available, the profile
target is valid for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> system:  Performs a system build of the unit.  This target should only
be used by Configuration Management to build the VICAR system.  It is valid
for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and PROCEDURE.  Note that the system target performs
a clean.src operation, which will delete the source code (since it just came
from the COM file, it's not needed any more).
<P>
<LI> compile:  Compiles all the source code, but does not link or install
the objects in a library.  It is valid for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> <i> Object module name</i>:  The name of an object module (with ``.o''
extension) may be given to compile only one module.  This is valid for PROGRAM
and SUBROUTINE.  Specifying an object module name is not particularly useful,
since <tt> make</tt> already determines which modules need to be compiled, so this
option will rarely be used.
<P>
<LI> <i> Executable name</i>:  The name of the program itself may be used as
a target, for type PROGRAM only.  It is equivalent to the target ``std''.
<P>
<LI> library.local:  Installs the object code in the local (private)
library.  The name of the library may be specified with the LOCAL_LIBRARY
macro in the imakefile.  The modules are compiled if needed first.
This target is valid for SUBROUTINE only.
<P>
<LI> library.system:  Installs the object code in the VICAR system library.
This option may only be used by Configuration Management.  The modules are
compiled if needed first.  This target is valid for SUBROUTINE only.
<P>
<LI> clean.obj:  Deletes all object code for this unit.  It is valid only
for PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> clean.src:  Deletes the source code, imakefile, and makefiles.  Be very
careful with this target!  It is intended mainly for system builds, where
the source code can be deleted after the build because it is maintainted in
the COM file.  If you are modifying code and do not have an up-to-date COM
file, then do <em> not</em> use the clean.src target.
<P>
<LI> doc:  Builds all the documentation files for the unit.  Currently, the
only supported type of documentation file is a TAE error message file,
although other types will be added.  Valid for PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE, and
PROCEDURE.
<P>
<LI> doc.errmsg:  Builds the TAE error message file.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Some examples may prove helpful.  The first example merely compiles a version
of the program into the local directory:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
make -f prog.make
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The next example is the same, except the documentation (if present) is built
as well:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
make -f prog.make all
</TT></PRE>
<P>
This example shows building the program for use in the debugger, for systems
that support the ``debug'' target.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
make -f prog.make debug
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The last example shows how to delete the object modules after a build.  This
is not recommended during most program development, because it forces all the
modules to be recompiled every time.  However, it can be useful to force a
recompile of everything on occasion.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
make -f prog.make clean.obj
</TT></PRE>
