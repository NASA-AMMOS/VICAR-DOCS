In the VMS-only world, pixels were always fixed sizes.  Many programs assumed
that FULL (integer) was 4 bytes, DOUB was 8 bytes, HALF was 2 bytes, etc.
This assumption is no longer valid.  A given machine may have different sized
data types, such as 64-bit (8 byte) integers.  Although all current supported
machines have the same sized data, it is still important to code programs
such that they will work with different sizes.
<P>
There are really two aspects to pixel sizes.  The first is when you are
dealing with files.  The file could be from a different machine, with different
pixel sizes.  In this case, you must use one of the RTL pixel size routines,
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsize</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeu</b>, or <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeb</b>.  These routines give you the
size of a pixel in bytes, given the data type and machine formats
(<b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeu</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeb</b> pick up the machine formats from an image
label).  Do not simply assume that REALs are 4 bytes long, as that may not be
the case on every supported machine.  The pixel size routines are designed to
be easy to call.
<P>
The second is when you are dealing with internal buffers.  Since internal
buffers are almost always in native format for the machine you are running on,
you can use the C function <tt> sizeof()</tt> to get the size of an element in
bytes.  Make sure that you use the proper data type for the pixel (see
Table <A HREF=subsubsection3.5.4.2.html#cpixtype><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>).  Fortran has no <tt> sizeof()</tt> operator or equivalent,
so you should use <b> xvpixsize</b> with machine formats of ``NATIVE'' or
``LOCAL'' instead.
