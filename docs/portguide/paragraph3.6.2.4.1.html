 <H4>Common Features</H4>
<P>
All the string conversion routines place great emphasis on the argument list
of the C routine that is directly called by Fortran.  Certain rules apply to
that argument list, and many of the common parameters reference it.  All of
these apply to the routine called <em> directly</em> by Fortran.  Suppose a Fortran
routine calls routine a(), which then calls routine b(), and b() wants to
call one of these string conversion routines.  <em> All</em> of the parameters
and rules will apply only to a()'s argument list.  Routine b() will need much
of the information passed in from a() in order to call the string conversion
routines, but all the information is relative to a()'s argument list.
In general, it's usually easier to have a() do all the conversion and let
b() deal only with C strings, but sometimes that is impractical.
<P>
<b> Include file</b>
<P>
In order to use any of the routines, you must include the file ``ftnbridge.h''.
As with other RTL includes, you must include xvmaininc.h first, and the names
must be enclosed in double quotes and end in the ``.h'' extension (you don't
need xvmaininc.h if ``vicmain_c'' is included).  Example:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#include &quot;xvmaininc.h&quot;
#include &quot;ftnbridge.h&quot;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<b> Imakefile</b>
<P>
The flag FTN_STRING must be defined in the imakefile for the program unit
if any C routine accepts Fortran strings.  This applies to both the
direct-called routine, and the routine that ultimately calls one of the
conversion routines.  The FTN_STRING flag causes the compiler to use a
lower level of optimization, which is required on some machines in order to
access the argument list.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>, for details
on the imakefile.
<P>
<b> FORSTR_PARAM and FORSTR_DEF macros</b>
<P>
In most routines (see below for the exception), you must include the macro
FORSTR_PARAM in the argument list of the directly called routine, and you
must put FORSTR_DEF at the end of the formal parameter declaration list,
just before the opening brace of the procedure.  FORSTR_DEF should not have
a semicolon after it, as the semicolon (if needed) is included in the macro
definition.  These macros are no-ops on many machines, but are required on
some in order to get at the Fortran string lengths.
<P>
The exception is routines that use the &lt;varargs.h&gt; variable argument
mechanism.  User subroutines should not normally use varargs, but it is used
fairly extensively inside the RTL to handle the keyword-value argument pairs.
If you use &lt;varargs.h&gt;, follow all the standard C rules for that mechanism,
and you should not use the FORSTR_PARAM or FORSTR_DEF macros.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
int constargs(a, s1, s2, b, FORSTR_PARAM)
  int *a, *b;
  char *s1, *s2;
  FORSTR_DEF
{ ...
}
<P>
int varargs(va_alist)
  va_dcl
{ ...
}
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<b> Argument restrictions</b>
<P>
All arguments to the direct-called routine must be the size of a generic
pointer.  Since Fortran passes everything by reference anyway, all of your
arguments will be pointers, so this should not cause a problem.
<P>
<b> Arguments to Fortran string conversion routines</b>
<P>
The arguments to the Fortran string conversion routines all apply to the
argument list of the routine that is directly called by Fortran, not to any
intermediary routines.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> FOR_STRING:  in/out, pointer to char
<P>
FOR_STRING should be the name of the argument that contains the Fortran string.
It should be declared as type ``char *'' in the argument list.  Simply pass
in the name of the argument, without any extra &amp;'s or *'s or anything.
The Fortran routine must declare the string as CHARACTER*n.  String arrays
(handled with the routines <b> sc2for_array</b> and <b> sfor2c_array</b>)
must be declared as single-dimension arrays of CHARACTER*n, but are still
declared as ``char *'' in the C routine.
<P>
<LI> ARGPTR:  input, generic pointer
<P>
ARGPTR should be the address of the first argument, whatever it is.  It does
not matter what the data type of the first argument is, or if it is already
a pointer to something else.  Simply put an ampersand (&amp;) followed by the
name of the first argument in the argument list.
<P>
<LI> NARGS:  input, integer
<P>
NARGS is simply the total number of arguments passed in to the routine.
Do <em> not</em> count FORSTR_PARAM as one of the arguments.  If you are using
&lt;varargs.h&gt;, pass in the actual number of arguments sent to the routine.
<P>
<LI> ARGNO:  input, integer
<P>
ARGNO is the number of the argument that contains the string to be converted.
If the string is the first argument in the list, ARGNO would be 1.  If it
is the fifth argument, ARGNO would be 5.
<P>
<LI> STRNO:  input, integer
<P>
STRNO is the string count for the string to be converted.  It is similar to
ARGNO, but counts only strings.  So, if the string you are converting is the
third argument, but only the second string in the argument list (because the
first one is an integer), then ARGNO would be 3 but STRNO would be 2.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Some examples may help to clarify things.  The routine <b> sfor2c</b> is used
in these examples, but the principles apply to all the string conversion
routines.  The calling sequence for <b> sfor2c</b> is
sfor2c(c_string, max_length, for_string, argptr, nargs, argno, strno).
<P>
<PRE><TT>
int constargs(a, s1, s2, b, FORSTR_PARAM)
  int *a, *b;
  char *s1, *s2;
  FORSTR_DEF
{ char cs1[11], cs2[20];
  sfor2c(cs1, 10, s1, &amp;a, 4, 2, 1);
  sfor2c(cs2, 19, s2, &amp;a, 4, 3, 2);
}
<P>
int constargs2(s1, s2, a, s3, b, s4, FORSTR_PARAM)
  char *s1, *s2, *s3, *s4;
  int *a, *b;
{ char cs1[101], cs2[31], cs3[80], cs4[5];
  sfor2c(cs1, 100, s1, &amp;s1, 6, 1, 1);
  sfor2c(cs2, 30,  s2, &amp;s1, 6, 2, 2);
  sfor2c(cs3, 79,  s3, &amp;s1, 6, 4, 3);
  sfor2c(cs4, 4,   s4, &amp;s1, 6, 6, 4);
}
<P>
int varargs(va_alist)
  va_dcl
{ char cs[11];
  /* set nargs = number of arguments, argno=argument #, and strno=string # */
  /* which all come from knowing what to expect in the argument list */
  forstr = va_arg(ap, char *);
  sfor2c(cs, 10, forstr, &amp;va_alist, nargs, argno, strno);
}
