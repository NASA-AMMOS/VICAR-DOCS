<LI> MODULE_LIST  - Specifies the list of source code modules.  The
argument  is a space-separated list of filenames, including the
extensions.  The extensions must match the language types in the supplied
USES macros.  All files must be in the current directory, i.e. no pathnames.
The MODULE_LIST is used to specify the modules to compile, link, put in the
library, and clean (delete after the build).  Although some of those functions
can be overridded with other lists, normally only MODULE_LIST will be used.
MODULE_LIST must be defined, except for PROCEDUREs.  MODULE_LIST can only
handle about 150 to 200 characters (2.5 lines) worth of filenames.  The limit
is somewhat lower on VMS than on Unix.  If you have more files than
MODULE_LIST can handle by itself, use the list extension macros
MODULE_LIST2, MODULE_LIST3, and MODULE_LIST4.  You must define MODULE_LIST
in any case; the extensions are also used if present.  They should be used in
order.  Each of the extensions can handle about 200 characters.  If you need
more than three extensions, contact the VICAR system programmer to add more
extensions.
<P>
<LI> MODULE_LIST2  - The first extension for MODULE_LIST if it is too
big.  See MODULE_LIST.
<P>
<LI> MODULE_LIST3  - The second extension for MODULE_LIST if
MODULE_LIST2 fills up.  See MODULE_LIST.
<P>
<LI> MODULE_LIST4  - The third extension for MODULE_LIST if
MODULE_LIST3 fills up.  See MODULE_LIST.
<P>
<LI> INCLUDE_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of
local include files, if any.  All includes delivered with the COM file must be
listed here, with the appropriate filename extensions.  If there are no
local includes, then do not define INCLUDE_LIST.  System includes, or
includes from SUBLIB, should not be in the list.  This list is used for the
source cleaning operation and for makefile dependencies.
<P>
<LI> FTNINC_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of Fortran
system and SUBLIB includes used in the Fortran modules, if any.  All Fortran
system and SUBLIB includes must be listed here, <em> without</em> any filename
extensions. If there are no Fortran system or SUBLIB includes, then do not
define FTNINC_LIST.  This list is used to create logical names or symbolic
links to the includes before the compile step.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_OBJ_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of
object files to delete (clean) after a compile.  If not given, this list
defaults to the value for MODULE_LIST, so CLEAN_OBJ_LIST should be rarely
if ever be used.  The names in CLEAN_OBJ_LIST must have <em> source code</em>
filename extensions.  <tt> vimake</tt> will convert them to standard object module
names automatically.  CLEAN_OBJ_LIST may be extended with CLEAN_OBJ_LIST2,
CLEAN_OBJ_LIST3, and CLEAN_OBJ_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST.
See MODULE_LIST for details.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_OBJ_LIST2  - The first extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST if it
is too big.  See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_OBJ_LIST3  - The second extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST if
CLEAN_OBJ_ fills up.  See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_OBJ_LIST4  - The third extension for CLEAN_OBJ_LIST if
CLEAN_OBJ_ fills up.  See CLEAN_OBJ_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_SRC_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of
source code to delete during a clean-source operation.  This happens during
system builds.  Since the source code just came from the COM file, it does
not need to be kept after the build.  If not given, this list defaults to
the value for MODULE_LIST, so CLEAN_SRC_LIST should rarely if ever be
used.  CLEAN_SRC_LIST may be extended with CLEAN_SRC_LIST2,
CLEAN_SRC_LIST3, and CLEAN_SRC_LIST4 in the same way as MODULE_LIST.
See MODULE_LIST for details.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_SRC_LIST2  - The first extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST if it
is too big.  See CLEAN_SRC_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_SRC_LIST3  - The second extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST if
CLEAN_SRC_ fills up.  See CLEAN_SRC_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_SRC_LIST4  - The third extension for CLEAN_SRC_LIST if
CLEAN_SRC_ fills up.  See CLEAN_SRC_LIST.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN_OTHER_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list
of other files to clean during a clean-source operation.  After a clean-source
is performed, only the files needed to execute the program (usually the
program itself and the PDF) and the original COM file should still exist in
the directory.  If any files are unpacked or created during the build process
that are used only during the build process and that not covered by
MODULE_LIST or INCLUDE_LIST (or automatically deleted as the .bld, .make,
and .imake files are), then they should be listed in CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.
These files are typically source code files that are used only on other
machines, if MODULE_LIST or INCLUDE_LIST are defined conditionally.
If there are no extra files (the usual case), then do not define
CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.  There are currently no extension macros defined for
CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.
<P>
<LI> LINK_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of object
code modules to link, in the order they will appear in the link statement.
It is only valid for type PROGRAM.  The object code modules must have a ``.o''
extension, even for VMS (it is converted to ``.obj'' automatically).  If not
given, this list defaults to the value for MODULE_LIST (which is automatically
converted to object-name format), so LINK_LIST should rarely if ever be used.
LINK_LIST may be extended with LINK_LIST2, LINK_LIST3, and LINK_LIST4 in
the same way as MODULE_LIST.  See MODULE_LIST for details.
<P>
<LI> LINK_LIST2  - The first extension for LINK_LIST if it
is too big.  See LINK_LIST.
<P>
<LI> LINK_LIST3  - The second extension for LINK_LIST if
LINK_LIST2 fills up.  See LINK_.
<P>
<LI> LINK_LIST4  - The third extension for LINK_LIST if
LINK_LIST3 fills up.  See LINK_.
<P>
<LI> LIB_LIST  - The argument  is a space-separated list of object
code modules to put in the object code library.  It is only valid for type
SUBROUTINE.  The object code modules must have a ``.o'' extension, even for
VMS (it is converted to ``.obj'' automatically).  If not given, this list
defaults to the value for MODULE_LIST (which is automatically converted
to object-name format), so LIB_LIST should rarely if ever be used.
LIB_LIST may be extended with LIB_LIST2, LIB_LIST3, and LIB_LIST4 in
the same way as MODULE_LIST.  See MODULE_LIST for details.
<P>
<LI> LIB_LIST2  - The first extension for LIB_LIST if it
is too big.  See LIB_LIST.
<P>
<LI> LIB_LIST3  - The second extension for LIB_LIST if
LIB_LIST2 fills up.  See LIB_LIST.
<P>
<LI> LIB_LIST4  - The third extension for LIB_LIST if
LIB_LIST3 fills up.  See LIB_LIST.
