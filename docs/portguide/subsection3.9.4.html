 <H2>CHARACTER*n for Strings</H2>
<P>
Possibly the biggest challenge specific to porting VICAR Fortran code is in
the area of character strings.  Formerly, BYTE or LOGICAL*1 arrays (or even
INTEGER arrays) were commonly used to store character strings (the term
``BYTE arrays'' here refers to all three).  These strings were created with
SUBLIB routines like <tt> outcon</tt> and <tt> mvl</tt>, and were used in
<b> qprint</b> and <tt> incon</tt>.  They were used interchangeably with
CHARACTER*n strings as arguments to many subroutines, especially the RTL.
This was made possible by the fact that CHARACTER*n variables were passed by
descriptor under VMS, which meant that the called subroutine could tell
whether it was a CHARACTER*n variable or a BYTE array (actually, the methods
used were nondeterministic and failed on occasion, but they worked most of
the time and were used anyway).
<P>
The Fortran standard does not support the use of BYTE arrays as character
strings.  They must be declared as CHARACTER*n variables.  Moreover,
descriptors are not used on most machines, so there is no way to tell the
difference between a BYTE and a CHARACTER*n variable.  Since CHARACTER*n
variables have a declared length associated with them, and BYTE arrays do
not, any routine expecting a length will get garbage if a BYTE variable
is passed in.
<P>
The RTL expects that <em> all</em> strings will be CHARACTER*n variables.  An
attempt to pass in another type of array will cause your program to crash
because the RTL expects string lengths on all strings (it will work under
VMS due to backward compatibility, but on no other machine).  This applies
to all RTL routines, but is especially important for the output routines
<b> qprint</b> and <b> xvmessage</b> (<b> xvmessage</b> is preferred over
<b> qprint</b> for new code), since those routines are often passed BYTE arrays
for output.  All strings destined for output must be CHARACTER*n variables.
The next section, Section <A HREF=subsection3.9.5.html#rdwrtftnstr><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, READ &amp; WRITE to Strings,
discusses how to do output conversion to create the strings (instead of
<tt> outcon</tt> <i> et al</i>).
<P>
While changing output strings to CHARACTER*n is possible (it's a chore, but
it's not hard), there are many areas in the code, in files and data structures,
where strings are stored in BYTE arrays, and it is not practical to change.
For that reason, character strings in BYTE arrays may be used if it is embedded
too deeply to change.  The SUBLIB routines <tt> mvcl</tt> and <tt> mvlc</tt> have
been provided to convert between BYTE arrays and CHARACTER*n variables.  Do
<em> not</em> just copy data directly to a CHARACTER*n variable from a BYTE array,
or vice-versa, since that will fail if there are descriptors present (some
other machines have descriptors, but they are formatted differently than the
VAX).  You must use <tt> mvcl</tt> or <tt> mvlc</tt> to convert strings.
<P>
Subroutines that expect strings should in general expect CHARACTER*n strings.
In the cases mentioned above where it is impractical to change, then only
BYTE arrays may be passed in.  Passing a CHARACTER*n where a BYTE array is
expected is just as bad as the opposite.  If possible, include separate entry
points to the routine that accept both types.  For example, the routine
<tt> vic1lab</tt> returns data in a character string, while <tt> vic1labx</tt>
returns data in a BYTE array.
