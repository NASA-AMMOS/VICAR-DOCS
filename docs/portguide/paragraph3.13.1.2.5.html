<LI> FTN_STRING - This flag, if defined, indicates that one or more of the
Fortran string conversion routines are called by any routine in the program
unit.  It is valid for types PROGRAM and SUBROUTINE.  The Fortran string
routines are <b> sc2for</b>, <b> sc2for_array</b>, <b> sfor2c</b>,
<b> sfor2c_array</b>, <b> sfor2len</b>, and <b> sfor2ptr</b>.  They are available
only from C.  Some machines (notably a Sun-4) require that modules using these
routines be compiled with a lower level of optimization.  If none of the
string conversion routines are called, then do not define this flag.
Technically, the flag must be defined if a C routine merely accepts a Fortran
string, even if a subroutine ultimately calls the conversion routine.
However, the same routine normally accepts the string and calls the conversion
routine.
<P>
<LI> C_OPTIONS  - The argument  defines extra options that are to
be given to the C compiler.  If no options are needed, do not define C_OPTIONS.
It is valid only in conjunction with the USES_C or USES_ANSI_C flags.  The
argument  may be in any format the C compiler allows, and may include
spaces.  There is no translation performed on the options, so they are
machine dependent.  C_OPTIONS is intended for program development use only.
A program or subroutine should rarely if ever be delivered with C_OPTIONS
defined.  If it is, the C_OPTIONS must be defined in a machine-dependent
conditional.
<P>
<LI> FORTRAN_OPTIONS  - The argument  defines extra options that are
to be given to the Fortran compiler.  If no options are needed, do not define
FORTRAN_OPTIONS.  It is valid only in conjunction with the USES_FORTRAN flag.
The argument  may be in any format the Fortran compiler allows, and may
include spaces.  There is no translation performed on the options, so they
are machine dependent.  FORTRAN_OPTIONS is intended for program development
use only.  A program or subroutine should rarely if ever be delivered with
FORTRAN_OPTIONS defined.  If it is, the FORTRAN_OPTIONS must be defined in
a machine-dependent conditional.
<P>
<LI> LINK_OPTIONS  - The argument  defines extra options that are to
be given to the linker.  If no options are needed, do not define LINK_OPTIONS.
It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  The argument  may be in any format
the linker allows, and may include spaces.  There is no translation performed
on the options, so they are machine dependent.  Under VMS, the options are
placed after any <tt> vimake</tt>-generated options; under Unix the options are
placed at the beginning of the command line.  LINK_OPTIONS is intended for
program development use only.  A program or subroutine should rarely if ever
be delivered with LINK_OPTIONS defined.  If it is, the LINK_OPTIONS must be
defined in a machine-dependent conditional.
<P>
<LI> DEBUG - This flag, if defined, causes the makefile to be built for
debugging.  It is valid for PROGRAMs and SUBROUTINEs only.  It is not needed
under VMS, or on some versions of Unix (like the Sun).  It is only needed
for certain varieties of Unix that do not have conditional macros in their
versions of <tt> make</tt>.  For these machines, you must set DEBUG in the
imakefile, and rerun <tt> vimake</tt>, to build a program for the debugger.  For
Unix machines that do have conditional macros, you can simply use the ``debug''
target in the standard generated makefile, so the DEBUG flag is not needed.
For VMS, you can use the ``DEBUG'' secondary option in the standard build file,
so again the DEBUG flag is not needed.  A program or subroutine should never
be delivered with DEBUG defined.
<P>
<LI> PROFILE - This flag, if defined, causes the makefile to be built for
profiling.  It is valid for PROGRAMs and SUBROUTINEs only.  It is not needed
under VMS, or on some versions of Unix (like the Sun).  It is only needed
for certain varieties of Unix that do not have conditional macros in their
versions of <tt> make</tt>.  For these machines, you must set PROFILE in the
imakefile, and rerun <tt> vimake</tt>, to build a program for the profiler.  For
Unix machines that do have conditional macros, you can simply use the
``profile'' target in the standard generated makefile, so the PROFILE flag is
not needed.  For VMS, you can use the ``PROFILE'' secondary option in the
standard build file, so again the PROFILE flag is not needed.  A program or
subroutine should never be delivered with PROFILE defined.
