<P>
The solution to the binary label problem is to have <em> separate</em> host
formats for the image and the binary label.  The system labels HOST, INTFMT,
and REALFMT describe the host formats for the image, while the system labels
BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT describe the host formats for the binary labels.
<P>
This of course means that it is possible to generate files that have data
in two different host formats: one for the image itself and one for the binary
labels.  This is not particularly desirable, but there is no practical way
around it.  As long as applications make sure they use the binary label host
formats while accessing the binary labels, there won't be a problem.
However, it does place a heavy burden on application programmers to make sure
they access binary labels correctly.
<P>
In the best of all worlds, all application programs that use a particular kind
of binary label would be ported at once.  That way, when one of the programs
starts writing data in Sun format, for example, all the other programs will
be able to read it.  However, this is not always practical.  Some applications
will be converted before others, and if a program writes a binary label in a
non-VAX format, it will not be read correctly by an unported program.  For
this reason, the implementors responsible for some kinds of binary labels may
choose to keep them in VAX format, at least temporarily, regardless of the
machine they were run on.  This way, unported programs can still access the
data correctly.  Image data doesn't have this problem because of the automatic
RTL conversion.
<P>
Doing this violates the general rule of read anything, write native, since
the applications are writing in VAX (possibly a non-native) format, but it
is justifiable in some cases.  Binary labels are typically small, so this
does not impose much performance penalty.  However, <em> all portable programs
must be able to read any host binary label format</em>, even if the decision is
made to always write the binary labels in VAX format.  The reasons for this
have more to do with system integrity than anything else.  Eventually, after
everything is ported, the decision may be made to start writing the binary
labels in the native format, which will simplify the code that writes them
considerably.  It would be ridiculous to keep things in VAX format when
everything is running on a Unix machine.  If all the programs already read
any format, then there will not be a problem when the switchover is made.
If a program was not coded to read any format, then it would read incorrect
data after the switch.
<P>
An alternative to forcing VAX format would be to port all the programs that
read the binary labels first.  Only after all the readers are ported would
the porting of the programs that write the binary labels begin.  This way,
you are assured of all applications being able to read the binary labels at
all times, since everything that could use them would be able to read a foreign
format before a file in that format was ever generated.
<P>
Note that this problem of timing the porting of programs applies not only to
programs that use binary labels, but also to programs that use a file for
anything other than image pixel data.  Some files currently in use in VICAR,
like statistics files and old-style IBIS files, contain several different data
types but are stored using the structure of a VICAR image file.  Like binary
labels, the RTL cannot convert the data in these files, so the application
must do it.  The issues discussed above, regarding always writing in VAX
format and porting the read programs first, apply to these files as well.
<P>
One additional thing to watch out for with binary labels is when using UPDATE
mode to change a file in place (i.e. modifying the file directly rather than
copying it).  In this case, the file is not converted to native format, since
it is being modified in-place.  The application must write out any binary
label updates in the format of the file, or it must read and re-write the
entire binary label in a native format.  The same is of course true for image
data, but the RTL handles the conversion automatically.
<P>
It is highly recommended that a set of subroutines be written for each type
of binary label to read/write/update that label.  If all applications used
this set of subroutines, then it wouldn't matter what format the binary labels
were kept in.  The subroutines would be able to adapt and hide the details from
the application program.  If changes were made to the binary labels, or even
if they were converted to property labels, the only code that would need to
change would be the subroutines that access them.
