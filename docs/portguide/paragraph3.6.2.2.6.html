<P>
Set up a translation buffer for data types only.  Both the source and
the destination must be in the native host representation.  It is useful
for converting internal buffers from one data type to another.  Don't
use it with data direct from a file, however, as files are not guaranteed
to be in the native host representation.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> BUF: integer-array(12), output
<P>
BUF is the translation buffer that this routine will set up, describing the
translation to be performed.
<P>
<LI> STYPE: string, input
<P>
STYPE is the source data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT label item
in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:  ``BYTE'',
``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''.  The types ``WORD'',
``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete and should
not be used.
<P>
<LI> DTYPE: string, input
<P>
DTYPE is the desired destination data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT
label item in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:
``BYTE'', ``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''. The types
``WORD'', ``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete
and should not be used.
<P>
<LI> STATUS: integer, output
<P>
The returned status value.  It is an argument in Fortran and the function
return value in C.  Any value other than SUCCESS indicates that the translation
is invalid for some reason, and the translation buffer should not be used.
