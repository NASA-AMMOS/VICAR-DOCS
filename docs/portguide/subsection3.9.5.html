The conversion of strings from BYTE to CHARACTER*n implies that the methods
used to do input and output to strings must change as well.  Previous code
often set up a buffer, then used <tt> outcon</tt> to put numeric values in the
string.  The result would then be printed.  For example (taken from the
program <tt> amos</tt>):
<P>
<PRE><TT>
      REAL*8 VRES, VRAD, VTAN
      LOGICAL*1 MS1(52)/' ','V','E','L','=','*','*','*','*','*','.','*',
     &amp;'*',' ',' ','(','V','R','A','D',',','V','T','A','N',')','=','(',
     &amp;'+','*','*','*','.','*','*',',','+','*','*','*','*','*','.','*',
     &amp;'*',')',' ','M','/','S','E','C'/
      CALL OUTCON(VRES,MS1(14),9,2)
      CALL OUTCON(VRAD,MS1(35),7,2)
      CALL OUTCON(VTAN,MS1(45),9,2)
      CALL QPRINT(MS1,52)
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<tt> outcon</tt> (and its counterpart, <tt> incon</tt>) have many serious portability
problems. They would have to be converted to output to CHARACTER*n variables
instead of BYTE arrays, since the output would be printed via <b> qprint</b> or
<b> xvmessage</b> anyway.  <tt> outcon</tt> and <tt> incon</tt> were originally
created to avoid using the Fortran I/O library in the days on the IBM mainframe
when memory was at a premium.  That is no longer a constraint.  The Fortran
I/O library is more portable, and easier to use.  For these reasons,
<tt> outcon</tt> and <tt> incon</tt> will not be supported in the portable system.
<P>
To perform input and output conversion, simply use the Fortran I/O package
on what is called an ``internal file''.  An internal file to Fortran is simply
a CHARACTER*n variable.  Just give the name of the variable (it may be a
substring if you wish) instead of the unit number in a Fortran READ or WRITE
statement.  Note that you must still write to a string and send the string
to <b> qprint</b> or <b> xvmessage</b>.  Do not attempt to write directly to
the terminal.  Any messages written directly to the terminal will not appear
in the session log, and could very well be printed in unexpected ways due to
interaction with VICAR I/O.  Also, messages written directly will not be
handled properly by the forthcoming VICAR GUI.
<P>
Here is one way to code the above example (the leading blank is not required
in <b> xvmessage</b>):
<P>
<PRE><TT>
      REAL*8 VRES, VRAD, VTAN
      CHARACTER*80 MS1
      WRITE (MS1,1001) VRES, VRAD, VTAN
 1001 FORMAT ('VEL=', F9.2, ' (VRAD,VTAN)=(', F7.2, ',', F9.2, ') M/SEC')
      CALL XVMESSAGE(MS1, ' ')
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Since an internal file may be a substring as well, you can do a more direct
conversion (although the previous example is generally the preferred method):
<P>
<PRE><TT>
      REAL*8 VRES, VRAD, VTAN
      CHARACTER*80 MS1
      DATA MS1 /'VEL=******.** (VRAD,VTAN)=(+***.**,+*****.**) M/SEC'/
      WRITE (MS1(5:13), '(F9.2)') VRES
      WRITE (MS1(28:34), '(F7.2)') VRAD
      WRITE (MS1(36:44), '(F9.2)') VTAN
      CALL XVMESSAGE(MS1, ' ')
</TT></PRE>
<P>
There are three things to note about this example.  First, the DATA
statement is separate from the declaration.  Putting initialization data on
the declaration line is not portable.  Second, the format specifier may be
put in-line in the WRITE statement if you wish.  Last, the numbers changed
from the <tt> outcon</tt> call because the leading blank was eliminated.  The
<b> xvmessage</b> routine always prints the first character, with no carriage
control.  So, all the character position numbers are one less than in the
<tt> outcon</tt> example.
<P>
Conversion of data from string to numeric form using READ is similar.
Use standard Fortran I/O using the CHARACTER*n variable as the internal
file.  Substrings are much more useful on READ to read only the portion
you are interested in.  For example, the following call form <tt> able86</tt> is
typical:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
      CALL INCON(NPAR, %REF(ALABEL(OFF+I+5:)),PAR,20)
      BUF(2) = PAR(1)                 !Frame number
</TT></PRE>
<P>
where ALABEL is the input string (already a CHARACTER*n variable), BUF(2)
is an integer receiving the value, and NPAR is ignored.  The value is an
integer in the range 0 to 99 (obtained from the documentation), so this call
could be converted to:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
      READ (ALABEL(OFF+I+5:),'BN,I2') BUF(2)
</TT></PRE>
<P>
You may want to make use of the ERR=n clause on reads in order to trap errors
such as a decimal point being present in an integer.
