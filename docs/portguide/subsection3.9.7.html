<P>
VMS has many non-standard extensions to its Fortran compiler, which are used
frequently in VICAR code.  Some of these extensions are widely available in
other vendors' Fortran compilers, while others are not.  In general, only
standard Fortran-77 code should be used in a portable program.  To find out
what is standard and what isn't, you could look at the ANSI Fortran standard,
or you can look in the <i> VAX Fortran Language Reference Manual</i>.  Anything
printed in blue in that manual is non-standard Fortran and should not be used,
except as noted below.
<P>
Some of the Fortran extensions are so useful that it would be impractical to
write VICAR code without them.  Fortunately, these extensions are common
industry-wide and are available in the Fortran compilers for every machine
MIPL is interested in.  Therefore, some extensions to standard Fortran-77 are
allowed.  These extensions are listed below.  You should not use any
non-standard statements or features that are not mentioned below.  If you
absolutely have to, then make sure it is isolated in a machine-specific
section of code, and you must provide a means for performing the same function
on machines that don't have that extension.  In other words, it's not worth
it to use non-standard Fortran features.
<P>
These are the <em> only</em> allowed extensions:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> BYTE and INTEGER*2 data types.  (Not LOGICAL*1).
<P>
<LI> Data type length specifiers in general (i.e. the *2 in INTEGER*2).  They
should only be used for pixel declarations, as listed in Table <A HREF=subsubsection3.5.3.2.html#ftnpixtype><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>.
<P>
<LI> DO-WHILE loops.
<P>
<LI> DO-END DO loops.
<P>
<LI> INCLUDE statement (see above for usage).
<P>
<LI> Symbolic names up to 31 characters, with at least 14 significant in
external names.
<P>
<LI> Lowercase letters and underscore (_) are allowed in symbolic names.
Names are not case sensitive.
<P>
<LI> Exclamation point (!) starts a comment anywhere in the source line.
<P>
<LI> Tab-format source lines (source lines may start with a TAB character).
<P>
<LI> IMPLICIT NONE statement.
<P>
</UL>
