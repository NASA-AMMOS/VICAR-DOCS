<P>
This section lists new features and potential incompatibilities of the new RTL
that aren't discussed elsewhere or need to be re-emphasized.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> <b> xvp</b> count problem
<P>
The COUNT parameter on <b> zvp</b>, <b> xvip</b>, and <b> zvip</b> behaves like
you would expect.  It returns the number of parameters given, and 0 if it
is a null parameter.  However, in <b> xvp</b>, COUNT behaves differently.  If
the parameter was defaulted (given a default in the PDF but not by the user),
then COUNT is returned as 0, regardless of the actual number of parameters
in the defaulted value.  This is a design flaw that must be maintained for
historical reasons.  See the discussion of COUNT under <b> x</b>/<b>  zvip</b> above for
more details.
<P>
<LI> <b> xvparm</b> and <b> xviparm</b> R8FLAG parameter
<P>
The R8FLAG parameter of <b> xvparm</b> and <b> xviparm</b> has been removed.
To return double precision real values, use <b> x</b>/<b>  zvparmd</b> or <b> x</b>/<b>  zviparmd</b>.
The R8FLAG parameter does still exist in the VMS version for backward
compatibility, however, it is <em> only</em> in the VMS version and may disappear
in the future.
<P>
<LI> Single quotes in label strings
<P>
Strings in the image label are delimited by single quotes (').
In the past, this meant that single quotes could not be included in a label
string.  With the new RTL, however, this restriction no longer applies.
A single quote in an input string (to <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b>) will be repeated before
being put in the label.  On output (from <b> x</b>/<b>  zlget</b>), the pair will be returned
as one single quote.  In other words, the repeating of quotes is transparent
to the application program.  Care should be taken when creating labels with
single quotes, as older versions of VICAR will not be able to read the file.
This problem should disappear in time as the old versions get replaced.
<P>
<LI> <b> xvpout</b> length parameter
<P>
The maximum string length parameter for <b> xvpout</b> has been removed.
It was formerly an optional argument, but was not used anywhere in the system.
Since the string length can be obtained from the Fortran string itself,
it is not needed for the Fortran <b> xvpout</b> call.  The length parameter
is, however, required on the C-language <b> zvpout</b> call.
<P>
<LI> Label key size expanded
<P>
The maximum size of a label key has been increased from 8 to 32 characters.
This will allow more descriptive labels and will facilitate data exchange with
other image formats, such as PDS and FITS.  Note that at the present time the
length of a task name is still truncated to 8 (only 8 are significant), but
when calling <b> x</b>/<b>  zlhinfo</b> you should now provide a 32-character buffer (33 in C
for the null terminator) in order to accomodate future expansion.  Property
names may be up to 32 characters long as well.
<P>
You must be careful when using longer label keys, at least at first.  An image
with a long label key will not be able to be read properly on an older VICAR
system.  Before using a long label key in an image, make sure that all
potential users of the image are using a version of VICAR that handles long
label keys.
<P>
<LI> Property type added to labels
<P>
The TYPE argument to <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zldel</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zlget</b>, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zlinfo</b> now
allows the type ``PROPERTY'' as well as ``SYSTEM'' and ``HISTORY''.
``PROPERTY'' must be specified for the TYPE argument of these routines to
access the property labels.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.6.6.html#proplabel><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Property Labels,
for more information.
<P>
<LI> Unix filename expansion
<P>
Under Unix, filenames accepted by the RTL (via <b> x</b>/<b>  zvunit</b>, either the U_NAME
optional or the INP or OUT parameters) now can contain environment variables
and usernames.  A reference of the form $<i> var</i> will be replaced with the
value of the environment variable <i> var</i>.  The name of the environment
variable (but not the dollar sign) may optionally be enclosed in curly braces
(${<i> var</i>}).  A tilde ( ) followed by a username will be replaced
with the home directory of that user.  A tilde without a username will be
replaced with the home directory of the current account.  Both of these
expansions exactly mimic the behavior of the C-shell, so they should be
familiar to most Unix users.
<P>
<LI> Temporary files
<P>
In addition, if a filename begins with a plus sign (+), the file is treated
as a <em> temporary</em> file.  It is created (or accessed) in the directory
pointed at by the environment variable $VTMP, which is normally set to
/tmp/<i> username</i>, where <i> username</i> is the username of the current
account.  The VMS VICAR style of specifying temporary filenames (by leaving
off the filename extension, which is replaced with a .Z<i> xx</i> extension),
is not supported under Unix.  If you do not put an extension on the filename,
then the file will be created without one, as you specified.  The + form of
temporary file will be supported in VMS in the future.  It is possible that
the translation of the temporary names to physical locations may change in
the future, in order to allow different filenames for different processes.
However, the + form of specifying the name will not change.
