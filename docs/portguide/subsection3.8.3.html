<P>
Many current VICAR applications and subroutines have VMS-specific code
embedded in them.  Some of it is obvious, like a system service call.
Some is insidiously difficult to find, like using a double floating point
value as a single.  This works because on the VAX the first half of a
double value looks like a float.  This is not the case on any other machine.
<P>
All the VMS-specific code must, of course, be eliminated or isolated.  If the
same thing can be done in a portable way, do it that way.  If not, then
isolate the VMS-specific code and write Unix code to perform the same
function.  If the function is useful as a general-purpose subroutine, then
put it in SUBLIB.  If not, include it with your code.  See the next section,
Section <A HREF=subsection3.8.4.html#machdepc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Machine Dependencies, for methods of dealing with
machine-dependent code.
<P>
An attempt is made below to list the types of VMS-specific code you will run
into.  This is not and can not be an exhaustive list, as there are far too
many potential problem areas that will only be uncovered with more experience.
Use this list as examples of what to look out for.  You should be familiar
with writing portable C code; if not then see a standard C manual.  If in
doubt, try it, or ask.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> The order of bytes in an integer (or any other data type) is
reversed on the VAX with respect to most other machines.  Any code that
depends on byte order must be changed to not do so.  Byte-order dependencies
typically come from converting between BYTE and other data types, where the
first byte of an integer is set to the value of a byte, then used as an
integer.  Use a type cast or the <b> zvtrans</b> routines instead.  This
practice is more prevalent in Fortran than in C, but it is something
you need to watch out for.
<P>
<LI> Integers and double precision floating point values must not be used
as short ints or single precision floats without conversion.  On the VAX,
a pointer to a double could be treated as a pointer to a float.  This works
because the bit pattern for the first half of a double is the same as for a
float.  The same is true for short vs. normal integers - a pointer to an int
could be treated as a pointer to a short or even to a byte.  This is not valid
on any other machine.  The IEEE floating point standard (which most other
machines use) has different bit patterns for doubles and for floats.
Therefore, if you wish to use a double as a float (or vice-versa) you must
convert the data with a type cast.  For integers, most other machines use
the ``big-endian'' byte order.  The first bytes of an int are actually the
higher-order bytes, unlike the VAX, so the value cannot be treated as a short.
<P>
This practice is most common (and hardest to find!) in subroutine calls,
where a program is sloppy about passing a pointer to the correct data type.
If the subroutine expects a pointer to a float, the pointer better point to
a float!  Fortunately, C normally passes items by value, so floats get
promoted to doubles in the subroutine call automatically.  However, when
things get passed by pointer instead of by value, the data type needs to be
checked carefully.  The function prototyping in ANSI C, when available, will
help find these kinds of problems.
<P>
<LI> VMS System Calls must be eliminated or isolated.  These include a whole
range of things, like system services (SYS$), VMS Run-Time Library calls
(LIB$, etc., not to be confused with the VICAR RTL), RMS calls or structures,
QIO calls for I/O, AST's (asynchronous system traps), and anything else that
is VMS specific.  Any subroutine or structure with a dollar sign ($) in it
is suspect, as most VMS system routines have a $ in the name.
<P>
There are basically two choices for dealing with these.  The first (and better)
choice is to dispense with system-specific calls and do things in a standard
way, when possible.  This could be achieved by using standard Unix-style calls
that do the same thing (many of which are implemented under VMS).  The second
choice is to isolate the VMS-specific code, and write corresponding code that
works on a Unix system.  Both versions could either be included in the program
itself (in-line or in a subroutine), or they could be put in a SUBLIB
subroutine if it's a capability that could be generally useful.  See the
next section for ways of handling machine-dependent code.
<P>
<LI> Assembly language (called Macro on the VAX) included in the program
will of course have to be rewritten.  You could write assembler versions for
every machine supported, but this is <em> highly</em> discouraged due to the
wide variety of available assembly languages.  The best solution is to
write the subroutine in a high-level language, preferably C.  The macro
code can be kept for use on the VAX if required, as long as there is a
high-level language version for other machines.  With the rapid rise in
machine performance over the past years, which is expected to continue in the
future, the use of assembly languages for performance reasons is becoming very
hard to justify, once the extra development, maintenance, and porting costs
are taken into account.  If a particular machine <em> really</em> needs the
performance boost, an assembler routine can be written for that machine,
assuming a C version exists for other machines.
<P>
<LI> Descriptors will have to be eliminated.  Only a few machines use
descriptors for Fortran strings, and the other machines that do are not
compatible with the VAX format.  Descriptors normally appear only in system
calls (which have to be changed anyway) and in interfacing between Fortran
and C.  The Fortran-C interface is described in Section <A HREF=section3.11.html#mixfortc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
Mixing Fortran and C, and there are routines available in the RTL to do
string conversions (the <b> sfor2c</b> family).
<P>
<LI> Fortran-C interfaces will have to be checked.  There are several rules
for mixing Fortran and C, including having separate names for subroutines that
are to be called from both Fortran and C.  Make sure you don't call a
subroutine from C by its Fortran interface, as that is not portable.
String handling is a particular problem.  See Section <A HREF=section3.11.html#mixfortc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
Mixing Fortran and C, for details.
<P>
<LI> Make sure that <em> all</em> input operations from files can accept files
written on a foreign machine.  This is often handled automatically, but there
are cases where it is not.  See Section <A HREF=section3.7.html#datatypes><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Data Types and Host
Representations, for details.
<P>
<LI> Do not assume that you know the size of a pixel in an input file.
An integer may not be four bytes on every machine that VICAR runs on.  Use
the RTL routines <b> zvpixsize</b>, <b> zvpixsizeu</b>, or <b> zvpixsizeb</b>
to get the size of a pixel.
<P>
<LI> Knowledge of the bit patterns used to store data is not portable,
especially floating-point data.  This is not very common, but any code
that does bit-twiddling is likely to have problems.  Byte-order dependencies
often creep into this sort of code.
<P>
<LI> Structure packing is not the same on all machines.  Some architectures,
like the VAX, pack all the items in a structure together with no extra
space.  Other architectures put every element of a structure at a longword
boundary, or something similar.  That is because they have access restrictions
on data, such as not being able to access an integer at an odd address.  This
can cause problems when writing structures directly out to a file (where another
machine may read them in), or trying to overlay one structure on another to
access certain fields differently.  If you need the size of a structure, don't
just add up the size of its elements, use the <tt> sizeof()</tt> operator on the
entire structure.  For an example of reading a structure from a file, see
Section <A HREF=subsection3.7.5.html#convtype><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Converting Data Types &amp; Hosts.
<P>
<LI> Use of unions to access the same bit pattern in different ways (like
EQUIVALENCE in Fortran) is very unportable.  If unions are used, make sure
you use only one of the definitions for any given piece of data.  If you use
the other definition, you must put a new value of that type into the union.
Unions may not be the same size on different machines, either, due to
structure packing considerations.
<P>
<LI> Not all the ``standard'' C run-time library routines are the same.
For example, the <tt> memcpy()</tt> function on VMS will handle overlapping moves
correctly (where the source and destination ranges overlap), but the same
routine on the Sun does not handle them like you might expect (use the
<b> zmove</b> function instead).  The <tt> open()</tt> call on VMS, while
standard in most respects, will accept extra arguments to define the RMS
file type.  These arguments are not portable.  Some of the less common or
newer routines are not available everywhere.  The Alliant has a rather
limited set of string handling routines, for example.
<P>
<LI> Optional arguments are not allowed in subroutines.  You must supply
all the arguments the subroutine requires.  If you are porting a subroutine
that accepts optional arguments, you have the choice of eliminating the
extra arguments, forcing them to be there, or creating different subroutine
names with different numbers of arguments.
<P>
<LI> Do not use numeric constants for things like error numbers or flag
bits.  VICAR constants could change in the future, and ``CANNOT_FIND_KEY''
is much more understandable than ``-38''.  System constants, for example the
argument to the <tt> lseek()</tt> function that says to search from the end of
the file, are even more likely to be different on different machines.  They
should always be symbolic constants, from the appropriate system include files.
<P>
<LI> Global variables should not be initialized in include files.  Under VMS,
a global variable can be initialized in an include file that is used by
several program modules.  As long as the initialization is the same in each
module (which is true since it comes from an include), then it works.  On
other machines, however, this is not the case.  You get a ``multiply defined''
error on the global variable.  One way to get around this problem is to use
a preprocessor macro to control the initialization.  If the macro is defined,
initialize it.  If not, just declare it.  The main program module then defines
this macro before including the file in question.  That way, the variables
only get initialized once.  For example:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
/* file x.h */
#ifdef INITIALIZE
int glob = 5;
#else
int glob;
#endif
<P>
/* one of the program modules (preferably the main one) */
#define INITIALIZE                /* delete this line in other modules */
#include &quot;x.h&quot;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> Make sure that variable and subroutine names do not conflict with Unix
system routines or the RTL internal routines.  Of particular interest is the
use of the variable name ``stat'', which is common in VICAR code for a status
return.  This conflicts with and overrides (if it's a global) the Unix system
routine of the same name, which is critical for the RTL to work.  Use of the
name ``stat'' will cause your program to break.  Use ``status'' or some other
name instead.
<P>
The other part of the problem is that most Unix machines do not have the
concept of a shareable image like VMS does.  Shareable images allowed
subroutine libraries such as the RTL to hide their internals from the program.
Without them, the entire RTL is linked with your program.  This greatly
increases the chance of name collisions, as the internal RTL subroutine
names (and TAE and SPICE and X-windows and ...) are suddenly visible, and some
of the names are fairly common.  Be very careful with subroutine and global
variable names.
<P>
The ultimate solution to this problem is to have a consistent naming scheme
for RTL internal names that won't conflict with applications.  Until this
is implemented, however, you must watch out for conflicts.  Even this fix won't
help other subroutine packages that MIPL does not have direct control over,
such as TAE, SPICE, and X-windows.
<P>
<LI> There are many differences in the file system and filename structure
between VMS and Unix.  The VMS pathname of
``disk:[dir.subdir]file.ext;version'' is quite different from the
Unix pathname of ``/dir/subdir/subdir/filename''.  Logical names do
not exist under Unix.  The analog to logical names, environment variables,
act quite differently in many respects (for example, the system <tt> open()</tt>
call doesn't know how to deal with environment variables, but <b> zvopen</b>
does).  Filenames and pathnames that are embedded in the program should be
removed and made available as arguments, both to handle architecture
differences and differences in directory structure on other machines.  Any
code that parses filenames from user input must be aware of the differences
and have code to handle each system.  Such code should be rare as the RTL does
most of the filename parsing; however, it does exist.
<P>
<LI> Filenames and pathnames tend to be longer under Unix than VMS.  Many
current programs arbitrarily limit filename parameters to 40 or even 20
characters in the PDF and in the code.  These limits need to be lifted.
Most of the time, the program never sees the filename (it lets <b> zvunit</b>
take care of it), so the solution is simply to not specify the maximum string
length in the PDF.  Instead of saying ``(STRING,40)'', just say ``STRING''.
If you need a buffer in the program code to handle the filename, allow at
least 255 characters (which is slightly more than the maximum TAE string size).
<P>
<LI> The filenames of the program units themselves may need changing.
C language modules must end in a ``.c'' to be compatible with <tt> vimake</tt>.
Other files have naming rules as well.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>,
for details.
