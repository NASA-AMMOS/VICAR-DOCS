<P>
The <tt> vpack</tt> program accepts a list of parameters as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vpack &lt;file.com&gt;  [-u]
                  [-s Source file(s)]
                  [-i IMAKE template file(s)]
                  [-b VMS build file(s)]
                  [-m UNIX make file(s)]
                  [-p PDF file(s)]
                  [-t Test file(s)]
                  [-d Documentation file(s)]
                  [-o &quot;Other&quot; file(s)]
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The ``<tt> -b</tt>'' (VMS build file) and ``<tt> -m</tt>'' (Unix makefile) should
not be used.  The ``<tt> -i</tt>'' (Imakefile) option should be used instead.
Machine-specific build files are allowed only under very unusual circumstances.
<P>
The ``<tt> -u</tt>'' option tells <tt> vpack</tt> that the module is unportable
(VMS-specific), so the correct header information can be generated (the
default for executing the COM file directly with no arguments is changed
from ``STD'' to ``SYS'').  If <tt> vpack</tt> is used with unportable modules,
``<tt> -u</tt>'' must be present; for portable modules, it must not be.
<P>
If you call the <tt> vpack</tt> program with no parameters, the program will tell
you that you have made a syntax error and will tell you the proper syntax
to use.
<P>
Based on the parameters provided, the <tt> vpack</tt> program will create the
new COM file (named in the first argument), read the lists of files in the
order given, and append them to the new COM file.  None of the source files is
altered or deleted.  The output of the program is the new COM file, which
is an ASCII file.  The <tt> vpack</tt> program requires that the COM filename be
included as a parameter and also requires that at least one list of files be
included.
<P>
As an example, the command necessary to assemble the Magellan program
<tt> view</tt> into a COM file is:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vpack view.com -s view.h host.c image.c overlap.c view.c
               -i view.imake
               -p view.pdf
               -t tstview.pdf tstview.scr
</TT></PRE>
<P>
You will note that an include file (view.h) is considered a ``source'' file.
Multiple file names can be separated by commas or spaces or both.  Of course,
if you spread the command over several lines like that, you would need to use
a continuation character appropriate for the operating system you are using.
<P>
The <tt> vpack</tt> program can be executed in three different ways.  The command
can be executed directly from the command line as shown above, assuming the
command line is long enough to hold the entire command.  It can also be
executed from a repack file created by the <tt> vpack</tt> program.  For example,
the repack file created for the <tt> view</tt> program is as follows:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
$ vpack view.com -
        -s view.h host.c image.c overlap.c view.c -
        -i view.imake -
        -p view.pdf -
        -t tstview.pdf tstview.scr
$ Exit
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Under VMS only, this file can be executed directly by typing:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
@view.repack
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The operating system will read the file and execute it exactly as if you had
typed the command from the command line.  The same limit on the length of
a command line applies in this case.
<P>
The third method for executing the <tt> vpack</tt> program also uses the repack
file, but uses it as a parameter to the program.  Type:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vpack view.repack
</TT></PRE>
<P>
to execute the program.  This is the preferred method, and is required under
Unix since DCL COM files cannot be executed directly.  There is no command line
length limit with this method.
<P>
The <tt> vpack</tt> program creates a COM file in the following format:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> A standard header which lists all of the available parameters and options
for the COM file in the VMS environment as comments.  This header also lists
the version number of the <tt> vpack</tt> program which created the file and the
name of the file.  See below for an example of a typical header.
<P>
<LI> DCL code which parses command-line options in the VMS environment and sets
up the necessary conditions to carry out the user's instructions.  For example,
if the user typed ``@file.com source'', this section would set the
DCL variables to create the source files from the COM file.
<P>
<LI> A repack file which can be used by the <tt> vpack</tt> program or can be used
stand-alone (under VMS only) to repack the COM file after making changes
to the files which comprise it.
<P>
<LI> The various sections of files which make up the COM file, e.g., source
file(s), PDF file(s), etc.  Each section of files consists of a label header
(e.g., ``$Source_File:''), followed by the files within the section.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
If the COM file includes an imakefile, for use with <tt> vimake</tt>, the COM file
header options will include many of the options which can be utilized by
the generated build file (e.g., COMPILE, ALL, SYSTEM, CLEAN, etc.).  The
<tt> vpack</tt> program is intelligent enough to adjust the header options based
on the type of files included.  If only source files are assembled into the
COM file, then the only options listed in the header will be those which
unpack the various files - such options as compiling and linking will not
be included.  If the COM file does not include a PDF file, then the option
to unpack the PDF file is omitted from the COM file, and so on.
<P>
A typical header, once again for the <tt> view</tt> program, is shown below.
Since the <tt> view</tt> program includes source files, a PDF file, test files,
and an imakefile, all of these options are listed in the header file.  The various options
for the COM file are only available under VMS.  The options are discussed in
greater detail below.  For further information on the use of <tt> vimake</tt> and
the build options, see Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>.

$! Compile+link proc for MIPL module view
$! VPACK Version 1.4, Thursday, June 25, 1992, 09:41:13
$!
$! Execute by entering:		$ @view
$!
$! The primary option controls how much is to be built.  It must be in
$! the first parameter.  Only the capitalized letters below are necessary.
$!
$! Primary options are:
$!   COMPile     Compile the program modules
$!   ALL         Build a private version, and unpack the PDF and DOC files.
$!   STD         Build a private version, and unpack the PDF file(s).
$!   SYStem      Build the system version with the CLEAN option, and
$!               unpack the PDF and DOC files.
$!   CLEAN       Clean (delete/purge) parts of the code, see secondary options
$!   UNPACK      All files are created.
$!   REPACK      Only the repack file is created.
$!   SOURCE      Only the source files are created.
$!   SORC        Only the source files are created.
$!               (This parameter is left in for backward compatibility).
$!   PDF         Only the PDF file is created.
$!   TEST        Only the test files are created.
$!   IMAKE       Only the IMAKE file (used with the VIMAKE program) is created.
$!   DOC         Only the documentation files are created.
$!
$!   The default is to use the STD parameter if none is provided.
$!
$!****************************************************************************
$!
$! The secondary options modify how the primary option is performed.
$! Note that secondary options apply to particular primary options,
$! listed below.  If more than one secondary is desired, separate them by
$! commas so the entire list is in a single parameter.
$!
$! Secondary options are:
$! COMPile,ALL:
$!   DEBug      Compile for debug               (/debug/noopt)
$!   PROfile    Compile for PCA                 (/debug)
$!   LISt       Generate a list file            (/list)
$!   LISTALL    Generate a full list            (/show=all)   (implies LIST)
$! CLEAN:
$!   OBJ        Delete object and list files, and purge executable (default)
$!   SRC        Delete source and make files

</TT></PRE>
<P>
As was stated above, each of the following options is only available when the
COM file is executed under VMS.  To unpack files from the COM file in the
UNIX environment, the companion program <tt> vunpack</tt> must be used.
<P>
It should be noted that many of these options pertaining to the build process
will not typically be used.  The preferred way of modifying an application is
to unpack it, change it, and repack the results when it's ready for delivery.
The same options are available on the <tt> vimake</tt>-generated BLD file.
However, the COM file may be edited directly without unpacking, in which case
these options could be useful.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> COMPile: The compile option is only available when the program's files
include an imakefile created for use with the <tt> vimake</tt> utility.  This
option causes the COM file to create the source file(s) and the imakefile, if
necessary.  <tt> vimake</tt> is called to create the appropriate VMS BLD file.
The COM file then executes the BLD file to carry out the compile command.  This
option also has several secondary options:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> DEBug: Compile for debug (<tt> /debug/noopt</tt>)
<LI> PROfile: Compile for PCA (<tt> /debug</tt>)
<LI> LISt: Generate a list file (<tt> /list</tt>)
<LI> LISTALL: Generate a full list (<tt> /show=all</tt>) (implies LIST)
<P>
</UL>
<P>
If, for example, you wish to compile the modules for debugging, the
appropriate syntax for executing the COM file would be:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
@view comp deb
</TT></PRE>
<P>
If you wanted to generate a list file as well, you would type:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
@view comp deb,list
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Notice that the secondary options are separated by commas, with no
intervening spaces.
<P>
This command would generate debuggable versions of the object file(s) for the
program.  To create the executable, you would still need to call the BLD file
with the &quot;LINK DEBUG&quot; parameters.
<P>
<LI> ALL: This option builds a private version of the executable in the
default directory.  By default, no secondary options are used.  Since the ALL
option carries out the COMPILE command, it accepts the same secondary options
described above.  The ALL option also unpacks the PDF and documentation files
and calls the BLD file to carry out any additional processing of the
documentation files when necessary.
<P>
<LI> STD: This option carries out the same actions as the ALL command, with
the exception that documentation files are not unpacked or generated.  STD is
the default option for portable modules (ones without the ``<tt> -u</tt>'' flag
on the <tt> vpack</tt> command).
<P>
<LI> SYStem: This option builds the system version of the executable and
executes the CLEAN option as well.  None of the secondary options are activated
for the COMPILE and LINK commands, while the CLEAN command has both OBJ and
SRC secondary options activated.   Additionally, the PDF and documentation
files are unpacked and any additional processing of the documentation files
needed is carried out.  This command should only be executed by Configuration
Management.  This option is the default (for compatibility reasons) if the
``<tt> -u</tt>'' (unportable) flag is given to <tt> vpack</tt>.
<P>
<LI> CLEAN: This option deletes and/or purges files from the disk, depending
on which secondary options are selected.  If the OBJ option is selected, the
command deletes any object and list files and purges the executable.  This
is the default secondary option for the CLEAN command.  If the SRC option is
selected, the source, imakefile, and build file are deleted.  Be careful with
the SRC option; make sure the COM file is up to date before deleting the files
that make it up.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The remaining COM file options all have to do with which files are unpacked
from the COM file.  This gives you complete control over which files are
removed from the COM file.  When the files are unpacked from the COM file,
the COM file itself remains unaltered.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> UNPACK: All files are created.
<LI> REPACK: Only the repack file is created.
<LI> SOURCE: Only the source files are created.
<LI> PDF: only the PDF file is created.
<LI> TEST: only the test files are created.
<LI> DOC: only the documentation files are created.
<LI> IMAKE: only the imakefile (used with the <tt> vimake</tt> program) is
created.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Since the COM file created by <tt> vpack</tt> is an ASCII file, it is editable
by the user.  It is recommended, however, that you follow the normal procedure
of unpacking the file(s), making and testing the necessary modifications, then
using <tt> vpack</tt> to rebuild the COM file.
