Selects the file to use as the primary input.  The primary input is normally
the first file given in the ``INP'' parameter.  It is used for a couple of
things.  If you don't give file attributes like size, type, etc. when you
open a file, the defaults are taken from the primary input.  Also, when you
create a new output file, the history and property labels for the new file
are copied from the primary input, in order to maintain the processing history
and file attributes.
<P>
In the rare cases where the first ``INP'' file is not appropriate for the
primary input, calling <b> x</b>/<b>  zvselpi</b> allows you to change the file that is
used as the primary input, or to disable the primary input altogether.
The file selected must still be one of the files in the ``INP'' parameter.
For example, you might be taking  input files and creating  output files
after doing the same processing to each.  You would want to set the primary
input for each output file to the corresponding input file, in order to preserve
the history labels.  Or, you may want to create a file with no history
labels whatsoever (except for the current task of course).
<P>
This routine should be called before the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b> of the output file you
want associated with the input.  The only routines that use the primary input
directly are <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsize</b>, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvbands</b>.  The primary input
in effect at the time each of these routines is called determines which input
file is used.  You may change <b> x</b>/<b>  zvselpi</b> after the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b> statement,
even if you do more processing to the file.  It will still use the primary
input in effect at the time the file was opened.
<P>
It is slightly more efficient to call <b> x</b>/<b>  zvselpi</b> before you open the
primary input file for other reasons, because it avoids an extra file open.
However, this should not have a big impact.
<P>
There is no status return from this routine.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> INSTANCE: integer, input
<P>
Determines which instance of the ``INP'' parameter to use as the primary
input.  Numbering starts at one, so you may restore the default behavior
by calling <b> x</b>/<b>  zvselpi</b> with an INSTANCE of 1.  An INSTANCE of 4 would
mean the fourth item in the INP parameter, etc.
<P>
If INSTANCE is zero, then the primary input is disabled.  You must provide
all necessary file size and type parameters to <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b>, since there are
no defaults.  The history labels also will not be copied, so the current task
will be the first (and only) task in the new file's label.  This is the
primary reason for disabling the primary input.
