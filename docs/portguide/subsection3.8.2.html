 <H2>Include Files</H2>
<P>
The standards for accessing include files have changed.  The changes are
necessary to ensure portability across platforms.  On the VAX, there was
not that much difference between putting an include filename in double
quotes, angle brackets, or without any delimiter at all.  To be portable,
attention must be paid to which of these methods you use.  Note that the
include file standards have changed since the first draft edition of this
<i> Porting Guide</i>.
<P>
There are five major classes of include files you will use.  They are
system, VICAR main, VICAR system, VICAR subroutine, and local.
<P>
Please keep track of which include files you actually need, and include
only those.  Some includes require that others be included first, but try to
achieve the minimum set.  Extra includes in your program don't gain you
anything, and they slow down your compiles.  They also make system maintenance
much tougher, since the source code must occasionally be searched to see what
programs use an include, and all programs that use an include must be
recompiled when it changes (even if it's not really used).
<P>
System include files are provided by the operating system.  Many of them are
OS-specific, but there are a few that are standard across platforms.  Make
sure the ones you need are available in both operating systems, or isolate them
in machine-dependent code.  System include files should be enclosed in angle
brackets and have the ``.h'' extension.  As examples, some of the known
portable includes are listed below.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#include &lt;varargs.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
One known <em> non</em>-portable file is &lt;unistd.h&gt;.  If you need symbolic
constants for the <tt> lseek()</tt> arguments (which are often contained there),
use the definitions provided in xvmaininc.h.
<P>
The VICAR main include file, which all VICAR programs should start with,
must be in lower case, with double quotes.  The name of the main include has
changed to ``vicmain_c'', with no directory specifiers and no ``.h'' extension.
Any modules other than the main program module that need VICAR definitions
should include xvmaininc.h, in lower case, with double quotes and the ``.h''
extension (xvmaininc.h is automatically included with vicmain_c).
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#include &quot;vicmain_c&quot;
   - or -
#include &quot;xvmaininc.h&quot;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
VICAR system includes are those provided as part of the RTL.  Their names
should be in lower case, with quotes and the ``.h'' extension.  The valid ones
are listed below.  Only a few of these should ever be used in application
code, notably ftnbridge.h, errdefs.h, and applic.h.  The rest should only be
needed in very unusual circumstances.  They should generally be in the order
listed below.  Please include <em> only</em> the ones you need.  Extraneous
include files you don't use will only slow down your compile and make system
maintenance harder.  TAE includes are handled as specified in the TAE
documentation.  They should be in double quotes, with the ``.inc'' or ``.inp''
extensions as appropriate.  The first four listed below are TAE includes.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#include &quot;taeconf.inp&quot;
#include &quot;symtab.inc&quot;
#include &quot;parblk.inc&quot;
#include &quot;pgminc.inc&quot;
#include &quot;defines.h&quot;
#include &quot;declares.h&quot;
#include &quot;externs.h&quot;
#include &quot;applic.h&quot;
#include &quot;errdefs.h&quot;
#include &quot;ftnbridge.h&quot;
#include &quot;xviodefs.h&quot;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
VICAR subroutine include files (class 2 and 3 SUBLIB, VRDI, etc.) should be
in double quotes, with no pathnames, and should include the ``.h'' extension,
just like for VICAR system includes.  For these includes, the directories
containing the includes must be available to the compiler.  This is normally
handled transparently, but some libraries will require a LIB_* macro in the
imakefile to access the includes.  See the descriptions in
Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>, for details.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#include &quot;vmachdep.h&quot;
#include &quot;gll_ssi_edr.h&quot;
#include &quot;xderrors.h&quot;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Local includes, which are delivered as part of the COM file and are used only
by that application, should be in double quotes, with no pathnames, and should
include the ``.h'' extension, just like for VICAR system and subroutine
includes.  However, local includes must be listed in the INCLUDE_LIST macro
in the imakefile so they can be cleaned up properly. See Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
<tt> vimake</tt>, for details.
