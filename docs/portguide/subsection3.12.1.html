<P>
The portable SUBLIB is completely independent from the old VMS-specific SUBLIB.
As a matter of fact, an application <em> cannot</em> use both at the same time.
If it is a portable application, it must use the new library.  If it has not
yet been ported, it must use the old one.
<P>
There are many reasons for the complete split between the old and the new
subroutines.  The major reason is that it allows programmers to change the
calling sequences easily for the SUBLIB routines, while still retaining the
old names.  Since the names are duplicated, an attempt to link to both
libraries would cause an error.  Another reason is that it ensures portable
applications will not attempt to use non-portable subroutines, an error that
would not show up on the VMS system.  Finally, it makes configuration management
of the system much easier, since portable subroutines are clearly isolated and
identified as such.
