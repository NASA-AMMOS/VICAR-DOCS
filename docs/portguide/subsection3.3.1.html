 <H2>About This Guide</H2>
<P>
The intended audience for this document is software developers who are
involved in porting a VICAR application or in writing a new portable
application.  It is assumed that the reader is familiar with programming
in the current VMS-only VICAR system.
<P>
This document discusses in detail the changes in the VICAR Run-Time Library
(abbreviated RTL in the rest of the document) that have been made in order
to make it portable.  This document is not a complete reference for the
RTL.  It is a supplement to the <i> VICAR Run-Time Library Reference Manual</i>.
Where the two documents conflict, this guide takes precedence.  Features of
the RTL that are not described in this guide are the same as documented in
the Reference Manual.
<P>
This document is broken up into several major parts.  The first section
describes some of the problems involved in writing portable VICAR code.
The next two sections describe the changes in the RTL.  The next six
sections describe writing portable C, Fortran, and TCL code in the VICAR
context.  The next three sections describe putting all the pieces together
to make a deliverable VICAR program or subroutine, the directory structure,
and examples.  The final two sections contain summaries of the major
portability rules and all RTL calling sequences.
<P>
If you as a programmer doing a port come across any portability issues that
aren't discussed here, or any problems with what is discussed, please bring
it to the attention of the VICAR system programmer (the author of this
guide) immediately.  It will be incorporated into the next release of this
document.
