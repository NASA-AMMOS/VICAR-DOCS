<P>
When porting a Fortran application, most of the RTL routine calls will need
to be modified slightly, due to the need for an argument list terminator and
the elimination of optional arguments.  A portable application must use the
new rules below when calling the RTL.  Although following the old calling
conventions instead will work under VMS, they will work <em> only</em> under
VMS.  To be portable, the new conventions must be used.
<P>
The new RTL calling sequence is described in detail in
Section <A HREF=section3.5.html#rtlcallconv><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, RTL Calling Conventions.  As a reminder, the
highlights are listed again below.

<LI> Terminator.  All RTL routines with keyword-value pairs of optional
arguments must have a terminator in the argument list, even if none of the
optional arguments are used.
<P>
<LI> Character strings.  All strings input to the RTL must be CHARACTER*n
variables or constants.  Formerly, BYTE or LOGICAL*1 arrays were allowed in
RTL arguments, but no longer.  BYTE and LOGICAL*1 do not have a string length
indication, and there is no way for the routine to tell whether the argument
is a CHARACTER*n (which does have a length), or a byte array.  Since the
length is required, BYTE and LOGICAL*1 no longer work.  This applies both
to string arguments and to keywords in the keyword-value pairs, since they
are strings also.  The change to CHARACTER*n is going to be most troublesome
with the output routines <b> xvmessage</b> and <b> qprint</b>, since they
are often called with BYTE arrays.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.9.5.html#rdwrtftnstr><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, READ &amp;
WRITE to Strings, below, for details on new methods of doing string output.
<P>
<LI> Optional arguments.  Pure optional arguments are not allowed.  Most
routines require all arguments to be specified, but a few have had some
removed.  See Table <A HREF=subsection3.5.2.html#varargs><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A> for a list of all the optional argument
routines.
