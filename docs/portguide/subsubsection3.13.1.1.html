 <H3>Creating and Using a VICAR Imakefile</H3>
<P>
Since <tt> vimake</tt> is based on the C preprocessor, every line in an imakefile
will be a C preprocessor command.  Most lines will be ``#define'', with some
comments and ``#if'' statements on occasion.  Comments are allowed, in the
standard C style (enclosed in /* ... */).
<P>
It may be easier to start with an example.  Here is the imakefile for the
program <tt> gen</tt>:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define PROGRAM gen
<P>
#define MODULE_LIST gen.c
<P>
#define MAIN_LANG_C
#define USES_C
<P>
#define R2LIB
<P>
#define LIB_RTL
#define LIB_TAE
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The first two lines define macros with values.  PROGRAM specifies that this
is an application program, rather than a subroutine.  It also specifies the
name of the application.  MODULE_LIST tells <tt> vimake</tt> what source code
modules make up the application.
<P>
The rest of the lines simply define switches; there are no values associated
with them.  MAIN_LANG_C tells <tt> vimake</tt> that the main program is written
in C (or ANSI C).  USES_C says that some (non-ANSI) C is used in the
application (that may sound redundant but is needed when there is more than
one module with mixed languages).  R2LIB says that this application goes in
R2LIB.  The LIB_RTL and LIB_TAE switches indicate which libraries to link
with, in this case the RTL and TAE libraries.
<P>
Due to the internals of how <tt> vimake</tt> operates, there is unfortunately no
real error checking.  You have to be sure to spell the macros correctly, or they
will simply be ignored.  This may cause surprising results.  If <tt> vimake</tt> is
not operating the way you expect, first check to make sure that all the
preprocessor macros are spelled correctly.
<P>
<tt> vimake</tt> can also handle some machine dependencies.  All the macros
defined in xvmaininc.h are available for use in #if statements.  This is
typically used to compile a VMS-specific module only under VMS, and its
Unix-specific counterpart only under Unix.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.8.4.html#machdepc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>,
Machine Dependencies, in the Porting C section, for details on what
preprocessor macros are available from xvmaininc.h.
<P>
To use an imakefile, simply type the command <tt> vimake</tt> followed by the name
of the imakefile.  Note that imakefiles must have a ``.imake'' extension, but
you should not give the extension on the <tt> vimake</tt> command.  The command is
the same under both VMS and Unix.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
vimake gen
</TT></PRE>
<P>
If you are running VMS, a file called ``gen.bld'' will be created (although
it is a DCL COM file, a ``.com'' extension would confuse it with the
packed application file).  This file can be executed to compile and link
the program:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
$ @gen.bld
</TT></PRE>
<P>
There are many options you can give on the command line to control the build,
which are described in Section <A HREF=subsubsection3.13.1.3.html#usebld><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Using the Generated VMS Build File.
<P>
If you are running Unix, a file called ``gen.make'' will be created when you
run <tt> vimake</tt>.  This file can be submitted to <tt> make</tt> to compile and
link the program:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
% make -f gen.make
</TT></PRE>
<P>
There are many different build targets you can give to control the build
process, which are described in Section <A HREF=subsubsection3.13.1.4.html#usemake><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Using the Generated
Unix Makefile.
<P>
The imakefile is actually composed of several parts.  These parts are
described below, with some examples.  Although they can be in any order,
the parts should generally follow the order listed below for consistency.
For a complete list of valid #define's, see the next section.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Type and name of program unit.  The valid types are PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE,
and PROCEDURE.  One of these must be defined.  The value for the definition is
the name of the program or subroutine.  The type of the program unit determines
which of the other <tt> vimake</tt> features are available.  There is currently
not much to be done for a PROCEDURE, but an imakefile must still be present,
for consistency.  Documentation may still need to be built with procedures.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define PROGRAM logmos
<P>
#define SUBROUTINE knuth
<P>
#define PROCEDURE midrarch
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> List of modules and includes.  The names of all source code modules
must be defined (this does not apply to PROCEDUREs).  MODULE_LIST should
contain the names of all the compilable source code, with the appropriate
extension.  Note that Fortran modules must end in ``.f'', <em> not</em> ``.for''.
Unix cares about such things.  The modules are listed in the order
they should be linked; i.e. the main module should be first (this can be
overridden by LINK_LIST).  INCLUDE_LIST should contain the names of
all include files that are local to the program or subroutine, i.e. ones
that are in the application COM file and not in p2$inc ($P2INC in Unix).
They should also have the appropriate filename extension.  Both lists should
be space-separated lists of names.  Don't use tabs, use spaces.  All the
names <em> must</em> be in lower case.  If you run out of room on a line, the
standard C preprocessor continuation character can be used, which is a
backslash (``'') at the end of the line, or use continuation lists.
<P>
Fortran system includes are a special case.  They should be listed in the
FTNINC_LIST macro, even though they are not a part of the program unit.
See Section <A HREF=subsection3.9.2.html#ftninc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Include Files, under Porting Fortran, for a
description of which includes go in FTNINC_LIST.  Note that local includes,
which are part of the application, go in INCLUDE_LIST instead.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define MODULE_LIST copy.f
<P>
#define MODULE_LIST logmos.c logmos_subs.c logmos_mosaic.c
#define INCLUDE_LIST logmos_defines.h logmos_structures.h logmos_globals.h
<P>
#if VMS_OS
#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_vms.mar
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_unix.c
#else
#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_unix.c
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_vms.mar
#endif
<P>
#define MODULE_LIST prog.f
#define INCLUDE_LIST myinc.fin
#define FTNINC_LIST errdefs sublib_inc
<P>
#define MODULE_LIST view.c utils.c image.c vdt.c plot.c host.c  
  overlap.c vprofile.c
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Note that VMS macro (.mar) and array processor files (.vfc) are allowed by
<tt> vimake</tt>, but they are of course VMS specific.  Also, when MODULE_LIST is
defined differently for different machines, make sure the unused source code
is listed in CLEAN_OTHER_LIST.  This is so a clean-source operation can
find all the source code to delete.
<P>
<LI> Main language.  If the application is of type PROGRAM, then the language
the main program is written in must be defined.  This is used by the Unix
version of <tt> vimake</tt> to determine which command to use to link the program.
The main program is defined as the one that the <tt> main44</tt> subroutine is
written in.  The languages that any other modules are written in do not matter.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define MAIN_LANG_C
<P>
#define MAIN_LANG_FORTRAN
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> Languages used.  For every different language used, you must define a
USES macro.  If any modules are written in Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) C
(which is the case for most VICAR code), then define USES_C.  If the modules
are written in ANSI C, then define USES_ANSI_C.  Note that USES_C and
USES_ANSI_C are mutually exclusive.  If any modules are written in Fortran,
then define USES_FORTRAN.  You must define both if you use both languages.
USES_MACRO and USES_VFC are also available, but of course they are
VMS-specific.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define USES_C
#define USES_FORTRAN
#if VMS_OS
#define USES_MACRO
#endif
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> Class of program unit.  If you are working with a type PROGRAM, then
you must define either R1LIB, R2LIB, R3LIB, or HWLIB to indicate the class of
the program.  If it is a portable SUBROUTINE, then define either P1_SUBLIB,
P2_SUBLIB, P3_SUBLIB, or HW_SUBLIB to indicate the class.  For unported,
VMS-specific subrouines, you can define OLD_SUBLIB or OLD_SUBLIB3. (these
are <em> only</em> to allow <tt> vimake</tt> to be used with the current system.  Just
because a subroutine has VMS-specific parts does not mean it goes in
OLD_SUBLIB, as long as there are Unix-specifiic parts that do the same thing).
The program class is used to select which library a subroutine goes in, to
pick up the proper include directories, and to allow error checking on
programs (e.g. a R2LIB program cannot use R3LIB subroutines), although the
error checking is not yet implemented.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define R2LIB
<P>
#define P3_SUBLIB
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> Documentation files for the module.  This applies to all types of
modules, and is in fact the only real use most PROCEDURES have for the
imakefile.  Any documentation that requires building should go in this
section.  Currently, the only type implemented is a TAE error message file
(.msg file), which is built using the <tt> msgbld</tt> program in TAE.  Error
message files are specified using TAE_ERRMSG.  Other types of documentation
will be implemented in the future.  If no supported documentation types are
supplied with the module, then do not define any of the documentation macros.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define TAE_ERRMSG sffac
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> Libraries needed for link.  This mostly applies to PROGRAMs, although
SUBROUTINEs might need it on occasion.  Every library you need to link to
should be specified by defining the appropriate LIB macro.  This normally
includes LIB_RTL and LIB_TAE for most VICAR programs.  The C run-time
library is automatic, so you don't need to include it.  The order is
arbitrary, since they are only #define's, but you should try to keep
them in order of highest-level to lowest-level, just to be consistent.
For a complete list of all LIB macros currently defined, see the next section.
<P>
It is quite likely, especially at first, that you will need a library that is
not available via <tt> vimake</tt>.  If so, contact the VICAR system programmer,
and the library will be added.  It is not hard or time-consuming to do.
Although some mechanisms have been included to allow you to set up your own
library names for testing, this is <em> highly</em> discouraged, and is
system-dependent in any case.  The VICAR system programmer needs to keep
track of what libraries are in use, so they are not missed when VICAR is
ported to a new system or delivered to an external site.
<P>
Some of the libraries have _DEBUG forms, which link the program with the
debuggable version of that library.  These should be used only during testing.
When the program is ready for delivery, it must not use any debuggable
libraries.
<P>
Some of the LIB macros also set up include directories for the C compiler.
In unusual circumstances, you might need to include a LIB macro in a SUBROUTINE
in order to pick up an include file.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define LIB_P2SUB
#define LIB_MATH77
#define LIB_RTL
#define LIB_TAE
</TT></PRE>
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Here are some more examples of VICAR imakefiles.  A simple C program,
<tt> gen</tt>, was listed previously.  Here is a simple Fortran program:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define PROGRAM copy
<P>
#define MODULE_LIST copy.f
<P>
#define MAIN_LANG_FORTRAN
#define USES_FORTRAN
<P>
#define R2LIB
<P>
#define LIB_RTL
#define LIB_TAE
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The following is an example subroutine that uses several different languages
and has VMS-specific code.  It illustrates how existing VMS macro code can
be retained for efficiency while still having portable C code for other
machines.  Although the subroutine has not yet been ported, the example shows
what the imakefile could look like when it does get ported.
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#define SUBROUTINE amosids
<P>
#if VMS_OS
#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_vms.mar
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_unix.c
#else
#define MODULE_LIST amosids.f camosids.c amosufo_unix.c
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST amosufo_vms.mar
#endif
<P>
#define P2_SUBLIB
<P>
#define USES_C
#define USES_FORTRAN
#if VMS_OS
#define USES_MACRO
#endif
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The last example is for a more complex program, that has lots of modules,
mixed languages, and uses several subroutine libraries.  Again, the program
has not yet been ported, but this is what the imakefile could look like.
