<P>
Given that separate Fortran and C-callable subroutines are needed, is there
any way of using the same subroutine name for both?  Unfortunately, the
answer is no.  On many Unix machines, such as Suns and DECstations, the
Fortran compiler automatically adds an underscore (``_'') to the end of
every external symbol either defined or referenced.  This is transparent
if you are using only Fortran, but becomes an issue when mixing with C.
For example, if your C-callable routine is named <tt> xyz()</tt>, the
Fortran-callable routine (in C) must be named <tt> xyz_()</tt> in order for
the Fortran routine to call it.
<P>
If adding an underscore was universally accepted, then the same routine
name could be used for both the Fortran and C interfaces.  The Fortran
binding would simply append an underscore.  However, this is not the case.
Several machines, notably the VAX and the HP 700 series, do not append
an underscore and so use the same name for both Fortran and C.  To
accomodate these machines, there must be a different name for the Fortran
and C versions of subroutines.  For example, the RTL uses the convention
of starting the name with ``<tt> x</tt>'' for Fortran (e.g. <b> xvread</b>,
<b> xlget</b>) and starting the name with ``<tt> z</tt>'' for C (e.g. <b> zvread</b>,
<b> zlget</b>).  There has been no firm naming convention established for the
VICAR subroutine library.  Many subroutines prepend a ``<tt> z</tt>'' to the
name, similar to the RTL.  Others use a mixed-case/underscore convention,
for example <tt> mpLabelRead</tt> or <tt> IBISColumnWrite</tt> for C and
<tt> mp_label_read</tt> or <tt> ibis_column_write</tt> for Fortran.  Use
whatever seems appropriate when creating a new subroutine.
<P>
You may be wondering how to append the underscore.  There is a macro
provided to do this for you in C, called FTN_NAME in ``ftnbridge.h''.
See Section <A HREF=subsection3.11.2.html#mixnamesub><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Naming Subroutines, for details.
<P>
The naming problem provides another incentive for having separate Fortran
and C interfaces in the first place.  Imagine a subroutine written in Fortran,
named ``<tt> xyz</tt>''.  Since some machines add an underscore, the C compiler
will see the routine name as ``<tt> xyz_</tt>''.  In order to call this routine,
the application programmer would have to add an underscore after the routine
name, which would not be portable, or use a macro, which would be
terribly inconvenient.  The application programmer would have to know
whether a routine was written in Fortran or C to know whether or not to
use the macro.  If the subroutine was converted to the other language at
some point, all the calls in all the applications would have to be changed,
which would be a nightmare.  To solve this problem, the burden is placed
on the subroutine writer.  The application programmer merely calls the
subroutine; the subroutine is then responsible for taking care of language
differences.  In this case, there would be a bridge routine named <tt> zyz()</tt>,
written in C, that would in turn call the Fortran routine <tt> xyz()</tt> using
the FTN_NAME macro after converting the arguments appropriately.
<P>
Since a Fortran subroutine called from C must have a separate bridge
routine anyway, it makes sense to require <em> all</em> subroutines to have a
separate bridge routine, with a different name.  Besides solving the
problems listed above, it allows much more freedom in choosing a calling
sequence that makes sense for each language.
