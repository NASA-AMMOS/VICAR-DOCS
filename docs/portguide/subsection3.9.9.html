 <H2>Machine Dependencies</H2>
<P>
There will be times where machine dependencies cannot be avoided, and
will be required in the code.  These dependencies can be based on the operating
system (VMS vs. Unix), or they can be based on the actual machine type or
flavor of Unix that is running.  Not all variants of Unix are created equal,
and sometimes there can be significant differences among machines.  This
section describes how to handle such machine dependencies in your Fortran
code.
<P>
Fortran is at a severe disadvantage when it comes to writing machine-dependent
code.  Simply put, Fortran does not have a portable means for doing conditional
compilation.  The C preprocessor does a wonderful job at this, but it cannot
be used to conditionally compile Fortran code in a portable manner.  For this
reason, the best method to write machine-dependent code in Fortran is to
write it in C instead!
<P>
If machine-dependent code has to be written in Fortran, it must be isolated
into separate source files.  Only the source files containing the code that
applies to the machine you're on will be compiled.  In-line code variants
for different machines is not possible due to the lack of a conditional
compilation method.
<P>
The filenames for the machine-dependent code should by convention end in an
underscore and the OS name or feature type that it depends on, for example,
``open_input_file_vms.f'' and ``open_input_file_unix.f''.
<P>
Once you have the files separate, you must get the appropriate one
to compile during a build.  This is handled in the imakefile (see
Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, cmd vimake, for details on the imakefile).  The
MODULE_LIST (or other appropriate macro) would be defined differently based
on the machine type.  Since <tt> vimake</tt> uses the C preprocessor, the rules for
machine-dependent preprocessor symbols should be used.  For example,
a program named ``prog.f'' calls a routine that is OS-dependent, named
``sub_vms.f'' and ``sub_unix.f''.  The module list for the imakefile
would look like this:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#if VMS_OS
#define MODULE_LIST prog.f sub_vms.f
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST sub_unix.f
#else
#define MODULE_LIST prog.f sub_unix.f
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST sub_vms.f
#endif
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The CLEAN_OTHER_LIST macro is needed to make sure that the source code
for the module not compiled is deleted during a clean-source operation.
See Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>, for details.
<P>
For more details on the preprocessor symbols allowed in the imakefile,
see Section <A HREF=subsection3.8.4.html#machdepc><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Machine Dependencies, under the section on
Porting C.  Note that specific machine types must not be used, as described
in that section.  Use feature defines instead.  Note that any such feature
defines must be in xvmaininc.h, since that is the only include file that
<tt> vimake</tt> can access.
