<P>
There will be times where machine dependencies cannot be avoided, and will
be required in the code.  These dependencies can be based on the operating
system (VMS vs. Unix), or they can be based on the actual machine type or
flavor of Unix that is running.  Not all variants of Unix are created equal,
and sometimes there can be significant differences among machines.  This
section describes how to handle such machine dependencies in your code.
<P>
There are two major ways of dealing with machine dependencies.  The
first is to isolate them into separate source files, and compile only the
one that applies to the machine you're on.  The second is to have the
machine-dependent code in-line, and use the C preprocessor to select the
appropriate version.
<P>
The first solution, separate source files, is appropriate when there are
whole routines that are implemented differently under the different operating
systems.  This option is normally used for differences between VMS and Unix;
only rarely will you have separate source files for variants of Unix.  The
RTL uses this method internally quite often.  The filenames should then
by convention end in an underscore and the OS name, for example,
``open_input_file_vms.c'' and ``open_input_file_unix.c''.
<P>
Once you have the files separate, you must somehow get the appropriate one
to compile during a build.  This is handled in the imakefile (see
Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>, for details on the imakefile).  The
MODULE_LIST (or other appropriate macro) would be defined differently
based on the machine type.  Since <tt> vimake</tt> uses the C preprocessor, the
rules listed below for machine-dependent preprocessor symbols should be used.
For example, a program named ``prog.c'' calls a routine that is OS-dependent,
named ``sub_vms.c'' and ``sub_unix.c''.  The module list for the imakefile
would look like this:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
#if VMS_OS
#define MODULE_LIST prog.c sub_vms.c
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST sub_unix.c
#else
#define MODULE_LIST prog.c sub_unix.c
#define CLEAN_OTHER_LIST sub_vms.c
#endif
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The CLEAN_OTHER_LIST macro is needed to make sure that the source code
for the module not compiled is deleted during a clean-source operation.
See Section <A HREF=subsection3.13.1.html#vimake><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, <tt> vimake</tt>, for details.
<P>
The second solution to the machine dependency problem is to use the C
preprocessor to conditionally compile parts of the code.  This method is
more appropriate for small differences and for handling differences between
various flavors of Unix.  The necessary preprocessor symbols are defined
in xvmaininc.h.
<P>
For differences between VMS and Unix, use the symbols ``VMS_OS'' and
``UNIX_OS''.  They are defined as 0 or 1, so use ``#if'' instead of
``#ifdef''.  You may use a ``#else'' to select the other operating system,
but if you do, the else clause should apply to Unix.  In other words, put
``VMS_OS'' on the if statement.
<P>
For example, to open a standard text file with the <tt> fopen()</tt> routine, VMS
requires that you give some RMS file type arguments to <tt> fopen()</tt>.
Otherwise, EDT will not be able to access the file properly.  This could be
coded as:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
/* Open an output text file */
#if VMS_OS
   file = fopen(filename, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;rat=cr&quot;, &quot;rfm=var&quot;);
#else
   file = fopen(filename, &quot;w&quot;);
#endif
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Differences between various flavors of Unix are a little more involved.
The file xvmaininc.h defines symbols for all the types of machines VICAR runs
on, like ``VAX_ARCH'', ``SUN4_ARCH'', ``MAC_AUX_ARCH'', etc.  <em> These
must not be used in program code!</em>  Think what would happen when an attempt
was made to port VICAR to a new machine if they were.  This new machine is
likely to have dependencies that are different than any other machine.  So,
someone would have to go through <em> every</em> program and subroutine in the
system, examine all the #if statements, and add the new machine to each and
every one of them in the appropriate place.  That would be a horrendous job,
and would make VICAR virtually impossible to port.
<P>
There is a solution.  Differences in machines are not really the issue here.
Differences in <em> features</em> are.  For example, the <tt> fstat()</tt> system
routine returns the optimal blocksize on some machines, but not on others.  The
Sun 4 and DECstation have it, but the Silicon Graphics and HP do not.  When
you want to get the optimal blocksize, you don't care what machines have it,
just whether or not the feature you want is present.  Another feature, the
<tt> mmap()</tt> command, is available on Sun 4 and Silicon Graphics, but not on
DECstation or HP.  Note that the groupings are not the same.  If you code
machine dependencies based on <em> features</em>, rather than <em> machines</em>,
then porting to a new machine means simply determining whether or not it has
the feature in question, and setting up the include files properly.
<P>
The file xvmaininc.h defines many of these machine dependencies that are
relevant for the RTL.  For example, the symbol ``FSTAT_BLKSIZE_OS'' defines
whether or not <tt> fstat()</tt> returns the optimal blocksize.
``MMAP_AVAIL_OS'' defines whether or not the <tt> mmap()</tt> routine is
present.  These and other <em> feature defines</em>, which all end in ``_OS''
by convention, must be the only ones used to handle machine dependencies.
Please make sure all such defines do end in ``_OS'', so searches through
the code to find the machine dependencies will be easier.  This leads to
the following general statement:
<P>
<blockquote> 
Conditional compilation statements to handle machine dependencies shall
never use machine names or types.  They shall instead use names of specific
features that are required in the code.  These names shall be defined in
standard include files based on the machine type.
</blockquote>
<P>
Where do these feature defines come from?  As mentioned previously, all the
ones needed by the RTL are in xvmaininc.h.  You should examine that file to
see what machine dependencies are currently known, and check it from time
to time, as it will change.  You will come across other areas of machine
dependencies that aren't listed in xvmaininc.h.  There are two ways to deal
with these.  The first is to contact the VICAR system programmer to add
the dependency to xvmaininc.h.  This is required if you need to use the
dependency in an imakefile, as xvmaininc.h is the only include file an
imakefile can use.
<P>
Since xvmaininc.h is under the control of the VICAR system programmer, it is
not always convenient for an application programmer to change the file.  For
that reason, an include file is provided in the portable includes (p2$inc
on VMS and $P2INC on Unix), called ``vmachdep.h'', that contains dependencies
that are needed only by application programs.  Use the style of xvmaininc.h
when adding new dependencies, and make sure you find out the correct setting
for every architecture VICAR supports.  If you can't find out, contact the
system programmer, and if you still can't, make note of the unknowns in the
include file.  Due to the unique nature of ``vmachdep.h'', please try not to
keep it reserved for very long.  Reserve it, add your definition, and
redeliver it, even if your application isn't ready for delivery.  That way,
other programmers can modify the file as well.
<P>
Do not define any feature dependencies anywhere other than these two files
(xvmaininc.h and vmachdep.h).  That will make porting VICAR much easier in the
future.
<P>
Some examples are in order.  These are paraphrased from the RTL source, but the
same rules apply.  If your definition is in vmachdep.h, the only difference
is that vmachdep.h needs to be included in your source.
