 <H2>Deprecated RTL Functionality</H2>
<P>
This section lists subroutines and capabilities of the RTL that are deprecated,
meaning they should be avoided if possible.  Deprecated functionality is still
supported and may be used for compatibility with old code, but it should not
be used for new code.  Features on this list are candidates for becoming
obsolete in the future if they are no longer needed.
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Parameter default flag
<P>
Some of the parameter routines return a default flag, which indicates whether
the parameter was input by the user or defaulted.  This flag should not be
used.  It is maintained for compatibility reasons, but the parameter count
should be used instead.
<P>
The major problem with using the default flag is that there is no way to
reset the flag under TAE.  If the parameter was entered, and saved in a
parameter file, there is no way for the user to reset the flag, even if the
default values are re-entered.
<P>
The parameter count should be used instead.  If you want to have a
program-supplied default, then allow the parameter to be nullable.  If there
are no values entered, then you can provide a default value in the program.
Otherwise, the defaults in the PDF should be real default values, and it
shouldn't matter whether the user entered them or not.
<P>
<LI> ULEN default to <b> zlhinfo</b>
<P>
The ULEN optional argument to <b> zlhinfo</b> should not be defaulted.  The
default value is 8 for backwards compatibility.  However, a value of 8 does
not leave room for a C string null terminator, so task names get run together
unless special care is taken.  Use at least 9 for ULEN to guarantee a null
terminator.
<P>
<LI> Using non-CHARACTER variables for Fortran strings
<P>
Although it is possible to treat strings in Fortran as BYTE or INTEGER arrays
rather than as CHARACTER*n variables, this is highly discouraged.  It is
non-standard Fortran to use arrays for string manipulation and should be
avoided.  The RTL will not accept arrays for string arguments (except on
the VAX for backwards compatibility).  The practice should be avoided in all
Fortran code.
<P>
<LI> WORD, LONG, and COMPLEX data types
<P>
The data types WORD, LONG, and COMPLEX are recognized by the RTL routines that
accept data types, for backwards compatibility.  However, they should never
be used in new code.  Use the standard set BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, DOUB, and
COMP instead.
<P>
<LI> <b> qprint</b>/<b> zqprint</b>
<P>
These routines should not be used, as they require numeric string lengths
and use Fortran carriage control, both of which are no longer necessary.
Use <b> x</b>/<b>  zvmessage</b> instead.
<P>
<LI> <b> x</b>/<b>  zlgetlabel</b>
<P>
These routines should be replaced with explicit calls to the other label
routines to retrieve only the labels of interest.  Reading the entire label
buffer and searching through it for a keyword (the common usage of
<b> x</b>/<b>  zlgetlabel</b>) is prone to error as the given keyword might exist as part
of some other, unrelated label.  It is permissible (if the label contents
are set up this way) to read a set of labels into a buffer and search that
buffer, but do not use <b> x</b>/<b>  zlgetlabel</b> for this.
<P>
<LI> <b> x</b>/<b>  zvend</b>
<P>
These routines should not be called from user code.  To abnormally terminate
a program, use <b> abend</b>/<b> zabend</b>.  To exit a program normally, simply
return from the <tt> main44</tt> subroutine.
<P>
<LI> <b> xvpblk</b>
<P>
The routine <b> xvpblk</b> is not portable and should not be used.  It is
retained only for backwards compatibility.  The reason it is not portable
is the same as the reason array I/O is not portable - the lack of pointers
in Fortran.  The C routine, <b> zvpblk</b>, is portable and can be used.
It could be used in a Fortran program in a manner similar to that used for
array I/O.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.9.6.html#arrayio><IMG SRC="/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Array I/O, for details.
<P>
<LI> <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsfile</b>
<P>
This routine is not needed.  Call <b> x</b>/<b>  zvadd</b> with the U_FILE optional instead,
which is completely equivalent.
<P>
<LI> <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsptr</b>
<P>
The parameter processing routines (<b> x</b>/<b>  zvparm</b> <i> et al</i>) will, in the
absense of string length information, return multivalued string arrays in
a packed format which must be unpacked using <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsptr</b>.  This packed format
(and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsptr</b>) should not be used.  Provide the parameter processing routine
with a CHARACTER*n array in Fortran, or a two-dimensional array of characters
with a non-zero LENGTH parameter in C, instead.  A normal array of strings
will then be returned, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvsptr</b> will not be needed.
<P>
<LI> PARMS files
<P>
The PARMS files created by <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpopen</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpout</b>, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpclose</b> should
be avoided if possible.  PARMS files are used to communicate parameters between
programs (the receiver has a PARMS parameter to receive the file).  They work
and are portable, but the internal implementation is necessarily non-standard.
Other communication methods, such as TCL variables or IBIS interface files,
are recommended instead.
<P>
<LI> Direct RTL tape support
<P>
The routines <b> x</b>/<b>  zvfilpos</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtpinfo</b>, <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtpmode</b>, and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtpset</b> are
used to directly manipulate 9-track tapes from within a program.  The use
of tapes in this way directly from a program is somewhat problematical under
Unix, so it is discouraged.  While this method of access is allowed, the
underlying implementation is not portable, and currently only runs on Suns,
and only on one brand of tape drive.  It is recommended that all processing
be done from disk files, with only operating system or special-purpose
utilities accessing the tape (these utilities would only transfer files to/from
tape, with no processing).
