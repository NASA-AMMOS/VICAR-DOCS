<P>
Set up a translation buffer for output.  The data will be converted from the
machine's native representation and data type of STYPE into a host
representation of (DIHOST,DRHOST) and data type of DTYPE.  So, it converts
from local to foreign format.  Since all processing must be done in native
format on the machine the program is running on, this this translation is most
often needed for output to a file.
<P>
This routine will be much less commonly used than the input routines.  The
general rule for applications is to read any format, but write the native
format.  Translation on output is not needed in this case.  However,
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_out</b> is provided for special cases where the data must be
written in a different host representation.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> BUF: integer-array(12), output
<P>
BUF is the translation buffer that this routine will set up, describing the
translation to be performed.
<P>
<LI> STYPE: string, input
<P>
STYPE is the source data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT label item
in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:  ``BYTE'',
``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''.  The types ``WORD'',
``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete and should
not be used.
<P>
<LI> DTYPE: string, input
<P>
DTYPE is the desired destination data type.  It corresponds to the FORMAT
label item in a file.  It may be one of the standard VICAR data types:
``BYTE'', ``HALF'', ``FULL'', ``REAL'', ``DOUB'', or ``COMP''. The types
``WORD'', ``LONG'', and ``COMPLEX'' are also accepted, but are obsolete
and should not be used.
<P>
<LI> DIHOST: string, input
<P>
DIHOST is the host representation for the destination of integral data types.
It corresponds to the INTFMT label item in a file.  It may be any of the
supported integer data types, which are listed in Table <A HREF=subsection3.7.2.html#intfmtlabel><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>.
It may also be ``NATIVE'' or ``LOCAL'', both of which mean the native
host INTFMT.  Note that DIHOST should be given even if you are dealing
only with floating-point data types.  See also <b> x</b>/<b>  zvhost</b>.
<P>
<LI> DRHOST: string, input
<P>
DRHOST is the host representation for the destination of floating-point data
types.  It corresponds to the REALFMT label item in a file.  It may be any of
the supported floating-point data types, which are listed in
Table <A HREF=subsection3.7.2.html#realfmtlabel><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>.  It may also be ``NATIVE'' or ``LOCAL'', both of
which mean the native host REALFMT.  Note that DRHOST should be given even if
you are dealing only with integral data types.  See also <b> x</b>/<b>  zvhost</b>.
<P>
<LI> STATUS: integer, output
<P>
The returned status value.  It is an argument in Fortran and the function
return value in C.  Any value other than SUCCESS indicates that the translation
is invalid for some reason, and the translation buffer should not be used.
