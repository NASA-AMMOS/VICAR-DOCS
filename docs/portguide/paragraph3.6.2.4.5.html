<P>
This routine converts a Fortran string array to a standard C null-terminated
array of strings.  The returned C string array is a two-dimensional array of
characters, <em> not</em> an array of pointers to strings.  The Fortran string
should be declared as a single-dimensional array of CHARACTER*n in the calling
routine.
<P>
This routine is somewhat unusual in that it actually allocates the memory
for the C string for you.  You pass in the address of a character pointer,
not the address of a buffer for the characters.  <b> sfor2c_array</b> calls
<tt> malloc()</tt> to allocate the required memory, and returns the address of
that memory in the pointer.  It is your responsibility to call <tt> free()</tt>
to free up that memory when you are done with it.
<P>
<b> Arguments:</b>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> C_STRING: pointer to string array, output
<P>
C_STRING is the address of a pointer that will be filled in to point at the
string array.  The returned array will be a two-dimensional array of characters,
not an array of pointers to strings.  Each string will have its own null
terminator.
<P>
This routine actually allocates the memory for the C string for you.
C_STRING is the address of a character pointer, not the address of a
buffer for the characters.  <b> sfor2c_array</b> calls <tt> malloc()</tt> to
allocate the required memory, and returns the address of that memory in
C_STRING.  It is your responsibility to call <tt> free()</tt> to free up that
memory when you are done with it.
<P>
The inner dimension of the array is returned via the MAX_LENGTH parameter.
Since you don't know this size at compile time, you can't access the strings
like a normal two-dimensional array.  It is easy enough to do your own
addressing, however.  For example:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
char *array;
int maxlen=0;
...
sfor2c\_array(&amp;array, &amp;maxlen, ...);
...
process_string(array+(i*maxlen));       /* to get at the i'th string */
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<LI> MAX_LENGTH: integer, input/output
<P>
On input, MAX_LENGTH is the alternate maximum length of each Fortran string.
Normally the maximum length is obtained from the input Fortran string array
itself (the ``n'' in a CHARACTER*n declaration).  If MAX_LENGTH is passed in
as 0, then this natural length is used.  MAX_LENGTH is an alternate maximum
string length in case one is provided as a parameter to the routine.  The
actual maximum Fortran length used is the minimum of the passed in MAX_LENGTH
(if not 0) and the natural Fortran string length.  MAX_LENGTH should almost
always be passed in as 0, as it makes little sense to override the natural
Fortran string length, especially on an array.  However, it is possible,
and might be useful in some unusual cases.
<P>
On output, MAX_LENGTH returns the size of the inner dimension of the C string
array that was allocated by <b> sfor2c_array</b>.  To access the i'th string
in the array, simply add i*maxlen to the returned array pointer.
<P>
<LI> NELEMENTS: integer, input
<P>
NELEMENTS is the number of strings in the array to convert.
<P>
<LI> FOR_STRING, ARGPTR, NARGS, ARGNO, STRNO
<P>
See the ``Common Features'' section above.
