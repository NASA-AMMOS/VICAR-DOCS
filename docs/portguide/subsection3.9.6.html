<P>
The RTL has a method of accessing a file, called array I/O, where the file
is mapped to virtual memory, and the address of the file is returned.  To
access the file, the program need not use I/O routines such as <b> x</b>/<b>  zvread</b> and
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvwrit</b>.  The file appears as a single large array at the returned address.
Actual file I/O is accomplished via the paging mechanism of the operating
system.  On operating systems where this is not available, it is simulated
by reading the file into a large chunk of memory when it is opened, and
writing it out again when it is closed.
<P>
The key to array I/O is returning the address of the file in memory.  This
address is actually a pointer to the data.  Under C, this is no problem.
Fortran, however, does not understand pointers.  Therefore, array I/O is
not allowed directly in Fortran.  There is a trick that can allow it to be
used in some cases, however.
<P>
Previously, the few Fortran programs that used array I/O did it by receiving
the address in an integer variable.  This variable could then be passed in to
a subroutine using %VAL, which passes the argument by value instead of by
reference.  The result of this was that the pointer got passed by value.
The called routine expected an array passed by address, in other words a
pointer to the array.  Since the variable containing the address was passed
by value, the subroutine was happy.
<P>
Unfortunately, %VAL is not portable and may not be used.  Therefore, pure
Fortran is unable to use array I/O.  However, C does not have any problems
passing things by reference or by value.  So, you can use array I/O in a
manner very similar to the SUBLIB <tt> stacka</tt> subroutine.  The <b> zvopen</b>
call must be made in a C-language function.  It can then pass the returned
address by value to a Fortran subroutine.  The Fortran subroutine can access
the file by treating the parameter as an array.
<P>
This method requires that all the Fortran code that uses the array I/O file
must be in the subroutine that is called from C.  This is quite similar to
the way STACKA works.  This may require significant revisions of the programs
that use array I/O from Fortran, but fortunately they are fairly rare.
<P>
Another alternative would be to simply not use array I/O.  Any program that
uses array I/O should have an alternate method of accessing the file using
line I/O (<b> x</b>/<b>  zvread</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvwrit</b>), in case the file is too big to be
opened via array I/O.  The line I/O backup is not required, but it is a good
feature to include if possible.  Use of array I/O only, with no backup line
I/O, can severely limit the size of files that may be processed by the
program.  With a line I/O backup, a VMS version of the program could use
array I/O if possible, but the Unix version of the program would use
exclusively the line I/O alternative.
