<LI> R1LIB - This flag, if defined, says that the program is a class 1
VICAR application, and makes the class 1 SUBLIB includes available to the
C compiler.  It is valid for type PROGRAM only.  One and only one of R1LIB,
R2LIB, R3LIB, HWLIB, and TEST must be defined for a PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> R2LIB - This flag, if defined, says that the program is a class 2
VICAR application, and makes the class 2 SUBLIB includes available to the
C compiler.  It is valid for type PROGRAM only.  One and only one of R1LIB,
R2LIB, R3LIB, HWLIB, and TEST must be defined for a PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> R3LIB - This flag, if defined, says that the program is a class 3
VICAR application, and makes the class 2 and 3 SUBLIB includes available to
the C compiler.  It is valid for type PROGRAM only.  One and only one
of R1LIB, R2LIB, R3LIB, HWLIB, and TEST must be defined for a PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> HWLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the program is an HW
application, specific to the Mars '94 project, and makes the HW includes
available to the C compiler.  It is valid for type PROGRAM only.  One and only
one of R1LIB, R2LIB, R3LIB, HWLIB, and TEST must be defined for a PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> TEST - This flag, if defined, says that the program is a test
application.  It is valid for type PROGRAM only, but will normally appear
only in the test code for a SUBROUTINE.  One and only one of R1LIB, R2LIB,
R3LIB, HWLIB, and TEST must be defined for a PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> P1_SUBLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is a
class 1 portable VICAR subroutine, and makes the class 1 SUBLIB includes
available to the compiler.  It is valid for type SUBROUTINE only.
One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined for a SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> P2_SUBLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is a
class 2 portable VICAR subroutine, and makes the class 2 SUBLIB includes
available to the compiler.  It is valid for type SUBROUTINE only.
One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined for a SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> P3_SUBLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is a
class 3 portable VICAR subroutine, and makes the class 2 and 3 SUBLIB includes
available to the compiler.  It is valid for type SUBROUTINE only.
One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined for a SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> HW_SUBLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is an
HW subroutine, specific to the Mars '94 project, and makes the HW includes
available to the compiler.  It is valid for type SUBROUTINE only.
One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined for a SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> OLD_SUBLIB - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is a
class 2 <em> unportable</em> VMS-specific VICAR subroutine.  The subroutine may
not be used with any portable applications.  OLD_SUBLIB is valid for type
SUBROUTINE only.  One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined
for a SUBROUTINE.
<P>
<LI> OLD_SUBLIB3 - This flag, if defined, says that the subroutine is a
class 3 <em> unportable</em> VMS-specific VICAR subroutine.  The subroutine may
not be used with any portable applications.  OLD_SUBLIB3 is valid for type
SUBROUTINE only.  One and only one of the *_SUBLIB macros must be defined
for a SUBROUTINE.
