<P>
<LI> LOCAL_LIBRARY  - The argument  defines the name of the local
library to use.  It is defined in a system-specific manner, so it will have
to be #if'd based on the operating system.  The default if LOCAL_LIBRARY
is not defined (the normal case) is ``sublib.olb'' for VMS and ``sublib.a''
for Unix.  LOCAL_LIBRARY is used differently for PROGRAMs and SUBROUTINEs.
For SUBROUTINEs, it is the name of the object library that the modules are
inserted into during a non-system build (system builds go directly to the
appropriate system library).  This is typically used during development and
debugging.  For PROGRAMs, it is the name of the object library that is
included in the link statement when the LIB_LOCAL flag is set.  Again, it
is used only during development and debugging.  A program or subroutine should
never be delivered with LOCAL_LIBRARY defined, since the program or
subroutine must build in directories other than yours.  LOCAL_LIBRARY is
provided merely as a convenience during program development.
<P>
<LI> LIB_LOCAL - This flag, if defined, links the program to the local
library defined in LOCAL_LIBRARY (or the default local library).  It is
valid only for type PROGRAM.  A program should never be delivered with
LIB_LOCAL defined, since the program must link in directories other
than yours.  LIB_LOCAL is provided merely as a convenience during
program development.
<P>
<LI> LIB_RDM - This flag, if defined, links the program to the RDM library.
It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  RDM is currently available under VMS
only, where it links as a shareable image.

makes the class 1 SUBLIB includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P1SUB
may be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_P1SUB_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the portable class 1 SUBLIB library.  It is valid only
for type PROGRAM.  A program should never be delivered with P1SUB_DEBUG, as
it is intended for program development and maintenance only.  The P1SUB_DEBUG
library has not yet been implemented.  This flag also makes the class 1 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P1SUB_DEBUG may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_P2SUB - This flag, if defined, links the program to the portable
SUBLIB library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  If you link to P2SUB,
you may <em> not</em> link to S2 or S3.  This flag also makes the class 2 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P2SUB may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_P2SUB_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the portable SUBLIB library.  It is valid only for type
PROGRAM.  If you link to P2SUB_DEBUG, you may <em> not</em> link to S2 or S3.
A program should never be delivered with P2SUB_DEBUG, as it is intended for
program development and maintenance only.  The P2SUB_DEBUG library has not
yet been implemented.  This flag also makes the class 2 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P2SUB_DEBUG may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_S2 - This flag, if defined, links the program to the old,
unportable, VMS-specific SUBLIB library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
S2 is available under VMS only.  If you link to S2, you may <em> not</em> link to
P2SUB or P3SUB.
<P>
<LI> LIB_S2_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the old, unportable, VMS-specific SUBLIB library.  It is
valid only for type PROGRAM.  S2_DEBUG is available under VMS only.  If you
link to S2_DEBUG, you may <em> not</em> link to P2SUB or P3SUB.  A program should

and maintenance only.  The S2_DEBUG library has not yet been implemented.
<P>
<LI> LIB_P3SUB - This flag, if defined, links the program to the portable
class 3 SUBLIB library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  If you link to

SUBLIB includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P3SUB may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_P3SUB_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the class 3 portable SUBLIB library.  It is valid only
for type PROGRAM.  If you link to P3SUB_DEBUG, you may <em> not</em> link to S2
or S3.  A program should never be delivered with P3SUB_DEBUG, as it is
intended for program development and maintenance only.  The P3SUB_DEBUG
library has not yet been implemented.  This flag also makes the class 3 SUBLIB
includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_P2SUB_DEBUG may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_S3 - This flag, if defined, links the program to the old,
unportable, VMS-specific class 3 SUBLIB library.  It is valid only for type
PROGRAM.  S3 is available under VMS only.  If you link to S3, you may
<em> not</em> link to P2SUB or P3SUB.

the HW includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_HWSUB_DEBUG may be used
from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_VRDI - This flag, if defined, links the program to the Virtual
Raster Display Interface (VRDI) library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
Under VMS it links the VRDI as a shareable image.  Some versions of Unix
support shared libraries, so VRDI will link to the VRDI shared library when
it is implemented.  This flag also makes the VRDI includes available to the
C compiler.  LIB_VRDI may be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_VRDI_NOSHR - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
VRDI as a standard link library, as opposed to a shared library or a VMS
shareable image.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  VRDI is preferred
over VRDI_NOSHR.  This flag also makes the VRDI includes available to the
C compiler.  LIB_VRDI_NOSHR may be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_VRDI_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the VRDI library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
A program should never be delivered with VRDI_DEBUG, as it is intended for
program development and maintenance only.  This flag also makes the VRDI
includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_VRDI_DEBUG may be used from type
SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_MATH77 - This flag, if defined, links the program to the MATH77
mathematics subroutine library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> LIB_SPICE - This flag, if defined, links the program to the SPICE
subroutine library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> LIB_FPS - This flag, if defined, links the program to the FPS routines
for the VMS array processor.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  The FPS
library is currently available under VMS only.
<P>
<LI> LIB_DTR - This flag, if defined, links the program to the VMS
Datatrieve database shareable image.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
The DTR library is available under VMS only.
<P>
<LI> LIB_SYBASE - This flag, if defined, links the program to the Sybase
database client library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  This flag also
makes the Sybase includes available to the C compiler.  LIB_SYBASE may be
used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_PDS_LABEL - This flag, if defined, links the program to the PDS
(Planetary Data System) label library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
This flag also makes the PDS label library includes available to the C
compiler.  LIB_PDS_LABEL may be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.
<P>
<LI> LIB_C3JPEG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the library
for the C Cubed JPEG decompression board.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
This flag also makes the C3JPEG library includes available to the C compiler.
LIB_C3JPEG may be used from type SUBROUTINE for this purpose.  Please note
that this library is <em> not</em> available on all platforms.  Currently, it
is available only on Sun-4 platforms, as the library is hardware-dependent.
If the library is not available (specified by the C3JPEG_AVAIL_OS flag
defined in xvmaininc.h), then the LIB_C3JPEG flag is ignored.
<P>
<LI> LIB_RTL - This flag, if defined, links the program to the VICAR
Run-Time Library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  Under VMS it links the
RTL as a shareable image.  Some versions of Unix support shared libraries, so
RTL will link to the RTL shared library when it is implemented.
<P>
<LI> LIB_RTL_NOSHR - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
VICAR Run-Time Library as a standard link library, as opposed to a shared
library or a VMS shareable image.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  RTL
is preferred over RTL_NOSHR.
<P>
<LI> LIB_RTL_DEBUG - This flag, if defined, links the program to the
debuggable version of the VICAR Run-Time Library.  It is valid only for
type PROGRAM.  A program should never be delivered with RTL_DEBUG, as it
is intended for program development and maintenance only.
<P>
<LI> LIB_NETWORK - This flag, if defined, links the program to the network
support libraries, including RPC's (Remote Procedure Calls) and sockets.
It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  This flag also makes the network includes
available to the C compiler.  LIB_NET may be used from type SUBROUTINE
for this purpose.  Currently, the Multinet network support libraries for the
VAX require a different include syntax.  For example, instead of ``rpc/rpc.h''
the syntax would simply be ``rpc.h''.  A conditional compile should take care
of this.  It is hoped that this difference will be resolved in the future.
<P>
<LI> LIB_TAE - This flag, if defined, links the program to the TAE object
library.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  Under VMS it links TAE as a
shareable image.  Some versions of Unix support shared libraries, so TAE
will link to the TAE shared library when it is implemented.
<P>
<LI> LIB_TAE_NOSHR - This flag, if defined, links the program to the TAE
object library as a standard link library, as opposed to a shared library or
a VMS shareable image.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.  TAE is preferred
over TAE_NOSHR.
<P>
<LI> LIB_FORTRAN - This flag, if defined, links the program to the Fortran
run-time library.  This flag should <em> only</em> be used if MAIN_LANG_C is
set; the Fortran library is included automatically for MAIN_LANG_FORTRAN.
The LIB_FORTRAN flag is needed only if you are linking a C main program to a
subroutine written in Fortran that uses some I/O statements (such as WRITE to
a string).  This subroutine may be hidden in a library such as P2SUB, so if
you get unexplained link errors, you might need this flag.  It is important
to note that the Fortran library is automatically included under VMS (where this
flag is ignored), so you will not know if you need it unless you try linking
the program on a Unix system.  LIB_FORTRAN is valid only for type PROGRAM.
<P>
<LI> LIB_C_NOSHR - Normally the program is automatically linked to the
C run-time library as a shared library or a VMS shareable image, and no flag
need be given.  The C_NOSHR flag, if defined, links the C run-time library
as a standard link library instead.  It is valid only for type PROGRAM.
C_NOSHR should only rarely be used.
