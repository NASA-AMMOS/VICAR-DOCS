 <H2>Calling Sequences</H2>
<P>
Keeping the old and new SUBLIBs separate allows the programmer freedom to
change the calling sequences for SUBLIB subroutines.  There are several reasons
for changing the calling sequences, which are discussed below.
<P>
The flip side of changing the calling sequences is that programmers doing a
port must pay attention to the new calling sequences, which may not be the
same as what they're used to.  Programmers will have to be careful that the
calling sequence they used is appropriate for the new SUBLIB.  However, the
benefits far outweigh those costs.
<P>
The first and most important reason for changing the calling sequence is to
have separate Fortran and C calling sequences.  The reasons for doing so have
been described fully throughout this document.  When the separate calling
sequences are created, they should be appropriate for the language involved.
The Fortran interface should look like a Fortran call, and the C interface
should look like a typical C call.  You should feel free to change the
calling sequences to fit.  For C, this often means accepting input arguments
by value instead of reference.  For Fortran, this often means accepting
CHARACTER*n variables instead of BYTE arrays.  Sometimes is it impractical
to change to CHARACTER*n, if the BYTE array is too entrenched.  In that case,
consider providing <em> two</em> calling sequences, one with CHARACTER*n and one
with BYTE.  See the routine <tt> vic1lab</tt> for an example of this.
<P>
Another important reason to change the calling sequences is that optional
arguments are not allowed.  Many current SUBLIB routines accept optional
arguments.  These arguments will either have to be eliminated, or forced to
be present.  This may mean multiple subroutine entry points in some cases,
one with the arguments present, and one without.  In general, this should be
avoided.  Decide whether or not the arguments are important, and if they are,
include them.  If you provide a reasonable default (like 0), then it's not too
hard for the application programmer to include the extra arguments when
calling the routine.
<P>
The last major reason for changing the calling sequence is more a matter of
style.  Some of the SUBLIB routines have very obscure calling sequences, that
are difficult to figure out.  If there is a better way to call the routine,
then feel free to change it.  However, don't make gratuitous changes just for
the sake of changing something; there should be a clear advantage in making
the change.
