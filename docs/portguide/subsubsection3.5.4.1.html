 <H3>Differences from Fortran</H3>
<P>
There are several differences in the C calling sequence from the Fortran
calling sequence.  The name change has been discussed already.  Also, the
use of a 0 or NULL terminator for a keyword-value argument list has been
discussed above.  There are two major differences that will come up in
porting programs, however.  They both have to do with making the interface
conform to standard C calling conventions.
<P>
First, most arguments are now passed by value.  The old RTL routines expected
all arguments to be passed by reference, since that's how Fortran does it.
This leads to all sorts of strange constructs like ``&amp;1'' in C, which is
not valid on most machines.  The rule is:  if it's an input value, it's passed
by value.  If it's an output value, it of course must still be passed by
reference (as a pointer).  For example, ``unit'' is a parameter to most of
the RTL routines.  Instead of calling zvread(&amp;unit, ...);, you
call zvread(unit, ...); (where ``unit'' is an integer).  The
routine <b> zvunit</b>, however, returns ``unit'' as an output, so it
would still have to be called ``zvunit(&amp;unit, ...);''.  Most values in
keyword-value pairs are input, so the ``&amp;''s would go away.  On
<b> zvget</b>, however, most values are output, so they are still passed as
pointers.  Arrays of items, as well as strings, are still passed by reference
as per standard C practice.  It sounds rather confusing, but it makes sense
once you work with it a little.
<P>
There is a pitfall to be aware of regarding <b> zladd</b>.  Since <b> zladd</b>
accepts as input the value to which to set the label, you might expect it to be
passed by value.  However, <b> zladd</b> can accept arrays of items,
since a label may be multi-valued.  Therefore, the ``value'' parameter to
<b> zladd</b> is always passed by reference.  This can be confusing if only
one value is being added.  This is not an issue with <b> zlget</b>, since
``value'' is an output from <b> zlget</b>.  You would expect ``value'' to be
passed by reference in that case.
<P>
Second, many routines had a ``status'' argument, which returned the status
of the command.  These arguments have been removed.  The status is now
the return value of the function.  So, instead of
``zvread(unit,&amp;status,...);'', it is now
``status = zvread(unit,...);''.
If you don't need the status value, it can be ignored entirely, as in
``zvread(unit,...);''.
<P>
Also, the handling of arrays of strings as arguments has been improved and made
consistent in the C interface.  Only a few routines use string arrays as
arguments, but the calls to those routines should be examined carefully.
These routines are <b> zladd</b>, <b> zlget</b>, <b> zlhinfo</b>, <b> zvpout</b>,
<b> zvparm</b>, <b> zviparm</b>, <b> zvparmd</b>, and <b> zviparmd</b>.
See below for the rules on passing string arrays.
