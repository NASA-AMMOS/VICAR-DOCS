 <H3>Character Strings</H3>
<P>
Most RTL routines take characters strings as arguments.  They appear in
parameter names, keywords, messages, and many other places.  Under the old
RTL, strings could be passed in either of two ways:  as Fortran CHARACTER*n
variables, or as BYTE or LOGICAL*1 arrays.  The array method will no longer
work.
<P>
All Fortran-callable RTL routines now accept character strings <em> only</em>
in Fortran CHARACTER*n format, which is the standard way of doing strings
in Fortran.  CHARACTER*n variables and constants have a length associated
with them (the ``n''), which the RTL uses to find the end of the string,
and to make sure that buffer overflow does not occur on output strings.
Byte arrays will not work, since there is no Fortran string length
information, thus no standard way for the RTL to find the end of the string.
Also, arrays of CHARACTER*1 will not work - the RTL will think the string
being passed in is one character long.
<P>
This change will be most apparent in the <b> qprint</b> and <b> xvmessage</b>
routines, which are often passed byte arrays in the current code.  This will
not work.  Use the new SUBLIB routines <tt> mvcl</tt> or <tt> mvlc</tt> to convert
between byte arrays and CHARACTER*n variables.  A better approach (and
highly recommended) is to change the program to use CHARACTER*n throughout.
Output formatting is actually much easier with CHARACTER*n variables.
