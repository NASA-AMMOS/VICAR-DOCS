 <H2>Backwards Compatibility with VMS</H2>
<P>
All RTL routines were designed to be backwards compatible with the old VMS
version.  So, programs that follow the old RTL interface rules will continue
to work on VMS.  This includes no need for a terminator, use of optional
arguments, calling the Fortran routines from C, and even the inclusion of
arguments that have been removed in the new version.
<P>
While the old ways still work, they work <em> only</em> under VMS.  Any program
that does not follow the new rules for calling the RTL will not work on
any other machine.  This may cause problems for people trying to develop
portable code under VMS, until they fully understand the new rules, because
an invalid program will work under VMS.  The way around this is to try the
program frequently on a Unix-based machine to make sure you are writing
truly portable code.
