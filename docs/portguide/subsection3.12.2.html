 <H2>When to Create a SUBLIB Subroutine</H2>
<P>
The first thing to ask when thinking about a new SUBLIB subroutine is:  Is the
routine generally useful?  If the program you're writing is the only one that
would possibly be interested in the subroutine, then don't put it in SUBLIB.
There is a lot of subroutines in the old SUBLIB that are not particularly
useful and are not generally used.  Try to keep SUBLIB clean by not including
subroutines that aren't generally useful.
<P>
On the other hand, make sure that anything that <em> is</em> generally useful
gets put in SUBLIB.  There are a lot of cases of duplicated code in the
VICAR system that would benefit from being made generally available in SUBLIB
(much of the Magellan software is a good example).
<P>
It's really a judgement call as to whether or not the subroutine should go
into SUBLIB.  The rules haven't really changed with the port to Unix.
The port merely allows an opportunity to clean up SUBLIB with minimal impact.
Just keep these guidelines in mind when thinking about creating a new SUBLIB
routine.
