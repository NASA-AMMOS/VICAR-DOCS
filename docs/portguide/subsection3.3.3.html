 <H2>Reasons for Porting</H2>
<P>
There are several reasons for porting VICAR to Unix.  The most important
reason is that Unix is an industry standard operating system, unlike VMS.
A wide variety of computer vendors support Unix.  Although each vendor's
flavor of Unix is slightly different, they are fundamentally similar.
The available hardware for Unix systems is typically much faster and cheaper
than VAX hardware.  So, the port removes the reliance of VICAR on one computer
vendor, and allows for a wide range of options.  Not only is the computer
itself cheaper, the various peripherals and display devices are often cheaper
as well.
<P>
Another reason for performing the port is that many scientists and
experimenters are moving towards Unix workstations at their facilities.
In order for them to use VICAR at their sites, it must run on their systems.
<P>
The Posix standard for operating systems closely mirrors many of the
Unix system calls.  Porting VICAR to Unix makes it possible to run on the
Posix standard eventually.  While VMS will also be Posix-compliant in the
future, the system calls to do so will be the Unix-style system calls.
<P>
Finally, porting VICAR to Unix allows an opportunity to clean up and modernize
the VICAR system.  While most of the applications will be ported straight
over (without any significant new features), the executive and system-level
VICAR code has been significantly updated.  Performing the port will ease
the transition into a more modern, window-oriented user interface.
