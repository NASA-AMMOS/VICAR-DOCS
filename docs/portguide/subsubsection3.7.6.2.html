<P>
This section discusses how application programs make use of the binary label
support features provided by the RTL.  All these features are documented
individually in Section <A HREF=section3.6.html#rtlroutchg><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, RTL Routine Changes, but an attempt
is made to tie them all together here.
<P>
It should be noted that the use of binary labels is discouraged, due to the
many portability problems outlined above.  Where possible, property labels
should be used instead, as they can usually serve the same function as binary
headers (but possibly not binary prefixes).  Binary labels are allowed, but
before creating a new format, stop to consider if property labels might be a
better approach.  See Section <A HREF=subsection3.6.6.html#proplabel><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Property Labels, for details.
<P>
The first problem is to open the file.  Opening a file for input, update, and
output will be covered separately, as the behavior is slightly different.
All modes make use of <b> x</b>/<b>  zvadd</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b> to open the files, and the
optional arguments mentioned may be used with either routine.
<P>
For an input file, the binary label host formats are obtained from the
BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT system labels in the input file.  The host
formats thus obtained are used for the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeb</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inb</b>
routines, as well as for <b> x</b>/<b>  zvget</b>.  The labels in the file are assumed to
be correct, so there is no real override.  If you need an override, you
can always use the host formats directly through <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsize</b> or
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_in</b>.  If the input file does not have the BHOST, etc. labels
(which could happen with older images), then VAX format is assumed.
If the input file has no label at all (COND NOLABELS), then the binary
host formats are obtained from the BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT optional
arguments to <b> x</b>/<b>  zvadd</b> or <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b>.
<P>
For an update file, the binary label host formats are obtained from the
file, just like for input files.  The only difference is if you wish to
change the binary label type of the file.  You of course would need to
re-write all the binary labels in the new format (be careful because the size
might change!), but you would also need to change the binary label format
system label items (BHOST, BINTFMT, BREALFMT) via <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b>.  If you use
<b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b> to change these items, then do <em> not</em> use <b> x</b>/<b>  zvget</b> on them, or
use <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeb</b> or <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inb</b> at all, as these routines may still
use the original binary label format.  The <b> x</b>/<b>  zlget</b> routine would get the
new values, however.
<P>
The BLTYPE optional argument is not used for input or update files.  You
may change the BLTYPE system label on an update file via <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b>, however.
See the next section for a description of BLTYPE.
<P>
Output files are a little more complex.  There are two basic cases:  either
you are converting the binary labels to native format, or you are leaving them
alone.  Which option you choose is controlled by the BIN_CVT optional
argument.
<P>
If you set BIN_CVT to ON, then you must write the binary labels in the
native host format.  The BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT system label items
get set automatically to the native host formats.  There is no override;
the corresponding optional arguments are disabled when BIN_CVT is ON.
You should also turn BIN_CVT ON if you are writing a new file with binary
labels in native format (although the name implies ``convert'', it really
applies to any binary labels written in native format).  If BIN_CVT is ON,
then the application must know the kind of binary label being written, so
please set the BLTYPE label using the BLTYPE optional argument.  See the
next section for a description of BLTYPE.
<P>
If BIN_CVT is OFF (which is the default), then the assumption is that you
are copying the binary label without converting it.  The binary label host
formats used will come from the primary input file.  If the primary input
is not available, they default to VAX format.  The primary input may of
course be changed with <b> x</b>/<b>  zvselpi</b>.  BIN_CVT OFF is the appropriate mode
to use for general-purpose applications that do not know the format of
the binary label.  The BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT optional arguments to
<b> x</b>/<b>  zvadd</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvopen</b> will override any other settings, so you could write
binary labels in an arbitrary format by setting BIN_CVT to OFF and setting
the three optional arguments to appropriate values.  If you need to write
specifically in VAX format, then do not depend on the default being VAX
format (as mentioned above).  That may not be reliable, depending on the
primary input.  If you want to write in a specific format, then make sure
you specify that specific format in the optional arguments.  You should not
use <b> x</b>/<b>  zladd</b> to change the binary label system label items on an output
file.  Specify them when you open the file.
<P>
The BLTYPE optional argument is active if BIN_CVT is OFF, and you should set
it if you know the kind of binary label being written.  BLTYPE will be picked
up from the primary input if you do not specify it.  See the next section for
a description of BLTYPE.
<P>
Once you have opened the file, then you must translate the data you read and/or
write to/from native format.  The actual translations are performed in the
same way as described in the rest of Section <A HREF=section3.7.html#datatypes><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Data Types and
Host Representations, except you are using the BHOST, BINTFMT, and BREALFMT
labels, and the <b> x</b>/<b>  zvpixsizeb</b> and <b> x</b>/<b>  zvtrans_inb</b> routines.
<P>
As mentioned previously, <em> all</em> binary label data read in must be converted
to native format before it can be used.  There can be no exceptions to this
rule.
<P>
Binary labels written out to a file may be in either native or foreign formats,
as discussed previously.
