 <H2>Philosophy of Port</H2>
<P>
When porting an application or subroutine, keep portability uppermost in your
mind.  In some cases, this will mean sacrificing some performance to achieve
portable code.  As long as the performance sacrifice isn't too great, this
is acceptable.  CPUs are getting faster and faster all the time.  A typical
Unix workstation has several times the CPU performance of the VAX 8650s that
MIPL currently uses.  Some pretty big performance hits could be taken before
they would be noticed.
<P>
On the other hand, in the near term, MIPL must still use the VAX 8650s.
Since code you port goes immediately into the development system when you
deliver it, and eventually becomes operational, it will be used on the
same hardware as it is currently.  Slowdowns here will be noticed.
Some VICAR subsystems have performance requirements; these must continue
to be met.  This may be modified somewhat based on circumstances, but try to
keep performance in mind.  If you cannot bring performance up to the
required level, then you might need to consider two separate versions, one
for VMS only and one that's portable.  This is highly discouraged, as it makes
maintenance twice as hard, but it may be an option in some cases.  Eventually,
when MIPL gets faster VAXes and more use is made of Unix machines, the
performance hit of the portable version will be acceptable and the VMS-only
version will be removed.  Note, however, that even if you do create a VMS-only
version of the program, it still must be able to read files written on foreign
machines, as all programs must.  Therefore, you cannot always just use
the current VICAR code as the VMS-specific version.
<P>
A secondary goal of the port is to improve the maintainability of VICAR
programs, including the cleaning out of the SUBLIB subroutine library.
A little time spent making a program more maintainable will pay off
many times over in reduced maintenance costs in the future.  Don't just
throw away old code gratuitously.  There is much to be said for keeping code
that works and has been tested over 15 years.  However, if a genuine
opportunity arises to improve the code, please do so.
<P>
There are many routines in the current SUBLIB that are not really needed,
or that almost duplicate other routines.  For this reason, a wholesale
conversion of all SUBLIB routines is not being performed.  Rather,
subroutines will be ported as they are needed during the conversion of
application programs.  That way, SUBLIB will get cleaned out in a relatively
painless way.
