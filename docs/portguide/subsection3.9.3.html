<P>
The use of EQUIVALENCE to convert among data types, especially byte to integer,
is widespread in current Fortran application code.  A byte will typically be
equivalenced to an integer, so storing the data in the byte variable makes it
accessible via the integer variable.  This practice is absolutely not portable.
EQUIVALENCE should <em> never</em> be used to convert any data types.  If you use
EQUIVALENCE, it must be done to conserve storage only.  You must access the
data using the same data type you stored it with.
<P>
To do data type conversion, use the <b> xvtrans</b> family of routines.  See
Section <A HREF=subsection3.7.5.html#convtype><IMG SRC="/VICAR-DOCS/icons/cross-ref.png"></A>, Converting Data Types &amp; Hosts, for details.
In addition, a method is available for converting between byte and integer
(since it is by far the most common conversion) that is more efficient than
calling the <b> xvtrans</b> routines.  This method consists of the functions
<tt> INT2BYTE</tt> and <tt> BYTE2INT</tt>.  To use them, you must include the file
``fortport'' in the subroutine.  ``fortport'' is a SUBLIB include, so it must
be listed in FTNINC_LIST in the imakefile to be available.  These conversion
functions assume that the data is strictly in the 0 to 255 range.  No bounds
checking is performed.  The functions are actually implemented on some
machines as array lookups rather than functions, and on others they may be
statement functions, so the include file must be present to get the appropriate
definition.

<PRE><TT>
        SUBROUTINE do_something(b, i)
        BYTE b
        INTEGER i
        INCLUDE 'fortport'
        b = INT2BYTE(i)
        i = BYTE2INT(b)
        RETURN
