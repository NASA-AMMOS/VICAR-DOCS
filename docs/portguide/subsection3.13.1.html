<P>
Most Unix programs come with a ``makefile'' that is run through the standard
Unix command <tt> make</tt> to compile and link the program.  The makefile 
escribes everything needed to build the program, including what options to use
for the compiler, what libraries are needed for the linker, and where to
install the manual pages.  Using <tt> make</tt> has many advantages, including
compiling only what has changed since the last compile.
<P>
Unfortunately, VMS does not come with a <tt> make</tt> program.  There is a
layered product available, called <tt> MMS</tt>, that performs the same function
with very similar makefiles, but it spawns a subprocess to do the compilation,
which is very slow under VMS.  It is also not available on all systems.
Therefore, it is not practical for VICAR applications or subroutines.
<P>
Previously, VICAR programs were built in one of two basic ways.  The first,
and older, method was to have compile and link statements directly in the
``.COM'' file that contained all the application pieces.  The pieces would
be extracted, and the compiles performed, all in one step.  The second method
was to have a separate compile and link file, typically named ``CLapp.COM''
(for Compile and Link the application).  This file was packaged in the
application COM file along with the source code.  It could then be executed
independently of the application COM file to build the program.
<P>
The use of an independent command procedure to build the program under VMS
has many advantages.  It allows the application COM file to be separate.
It works on all VMS machines, since DCL is standard.  And, it is fast, since
no subprocesses need to be created.  The old CL files suffer from a terrible
lack of standardization, and are not the easiest things to use, but the
basic concept is a good one.
<P>
So, it boils down to this.  To build applications under Unix, it is highly
desirable to use <tt> make</tt> with a makefile.  To build them under VMS, it is
highly desirable to use DCL with a command procedure.  Obviously, these two
files (the makefile and the command procedure) are going to be incompatible.
Worse yet, there is quite a bit of variation required for makefiles on
different Unix machines.  The commands used often vary, and sometimes there
are differences in the format and capabilities of <tt> make</tt> itself.
<P>
It would be very cumbersome to require the VICAR application programmer to
maintain two sets of build files for every application (for VMS and Unix).
Furthermore, the differences in Unix makefiles would make it almost
impossible to come up with a single makefile for all Unix systems.  Fortunately,
a program called <tt> imake</tt> has been written to solve these problems.
<P>
<tt> imake</tt> is used extensively in the X-windows system to allow building
the system on many different platforms.  TAE uses it as well.  It is a program
that makes makefiles.  <tt> imake</tt> makes use of the C preprocessor for macros
and conditional statements in order to customize the makefile for a particular
platform.  The input ``imakefile'' is a reduced makefile that contains only
the program-specific parts, not the system-specific parts.  A template file
provides the system-specific parts of the makefile for each machine type.
The <tt> imake</tt> program does some minor cleanup on the imakefile, runs it and
the template through the C preprocessor, and does some cleanup on the output.
The result is a makefile that is customized for the system you are on.
<P>
This helps to create Unix makefiles, but what about VMS?  If you are familiar
with <tt> imake</tt>, you know that the imakefiles typically look quite a bit like
a makefile.  There is a set of rules and definitions that are set up at the
top of the makefile, but basically the structure of the imakefile is retained
in the makefile.  It would be impossible to generate a VMS command procedure
from a typical imakefile.
<P>
The VICAR program <tt> vimake</tt> takes the concept of <tt> imake</tt> and goes one
step further.  Since the compile and link statements for all VICAR programs
are quite similar, they do not need to be specified at all in the imakefile.
In fact, <tt> vimake</tt> extracts <em> all</em> of the control out of the imakefile,
leaving only C preprocessor commands.
<P>
<blockquote> 
The VICAR imakefile contains only a description of <em> what</em> is to be built,
not <em> how</em> to build it.
</blockquote>
<P>
A VICAR imakefile consists only of C preprocessor statements, mostly #define's
and a few #if's.  These #define statements set up the filenames used in
the program, and select various options on how to build the program.  The
<tt> vimake</tt> program uses this information and a system-specific template to
create a build file for any system.  Under VMS, it creates a DCL command file
that will build the program.  Under Unix, it creates a makefile instead.  The
makefile and DCL command file are never delivered with the program; only the
imakefile is.
<P>
There are many advantages to this scheme.  First of all, the programmer need
only create one imakefile, instead of separate build files for each system.
Second, it is much easier to create the imakefile than it would be to create
a full-blown build file.  Third, all build files are standardized, since they
are created entirely by the <tt> vimake</tt> templates.  They all operate the
same, and can be fairly complex since the application programmer never modifies
them directly.  Fourth, locations of libraries and other files are standardized,
since the imakefile doesn't specify where the library is, just what library it
wants.  Finally, changing the way applications are built is easy.  Only the
templates need to change, and all applications will be built the new way.
